Our Wider Impact Report 2013
This report takes a look at our commitment to our employees,
the environment and the communities in which we operate.

About this report
We report on our people and corporate responsibility
performance openly and transparently. We’ve
continued to improve this year by changing the way
we communicate, to become more responsive to our
stakeholders’ needs.
Our new approach includes a smaller annual
report in pdf called ‘Our Wider Impact Report
2013’ covering material people and corporate
responsibility information and regular and
timely updates on our corporate website
at www.aviva.com/corporate-responsibility
The most material CR and people information
and data is also included in our Annual report and
accounts within the Strategic Report, as required

Our people matter

People face uncertainty, challenges and choices
every day. Life is complex and unpredictable. At
Aviva, we make life more certain. Our purpose is
to free people from fear of uncertainty which allows
our customers to get on and lead richer, happier
lives. This is what unites us as an organisation. Along
with our four values – care more, kill complexity,
never rest and create legacy – this guides us to
navigate the future with confidence in a rapidly
changing world as an ethically, environmentally
and socially responsible insurer.
A key priority is to make sure we are financially
strong, so that we can deliver on the promises we
have made to our customers, business partners,
employees, shareholders and communities. We
took action to improve our financial position during
the year, securing our legacy. Today our economic
capital surplus is double the level of two years ago.
During the year, we paid out £27.5 billion in claims
and benefits to our customers, to enable them
to get on with their lives. I am proud of our front
line staff, who go out of their way to respond to
our customers’ needs – whether that be the care
and time our people take to talk to critical illness
customers who have cancer, or a customer who
has had their lives turned upside down during the
UK or Canadian floods. During the UK floods, we

2

accepted 99.9 per cent of claims and our people
were on the road seven days a week, knocking
on our customers’ doors to help them claim.
This is where I think we deliver and our people
have been exceptional.
Through our community programmes, we have
made a positive difference to the lives of many
around the world. Our Street to School programme
has now helped over 800,000 street connected
children and we have helped 4,300 street children
in Indonesia obtain birth certificates. In Canada,
our Aviva Community Fund encourages Canadians
to share ideas and vote for causes that are
meaningful to their communities. Winners have
shared $1 million for projects such as rebuilding
flood ravaged camp grounds, youth enablement
programmes, and building new playgrounds.
As a company we need to create legacy and as
leaders we need to be good ancestors. We’re a
long-term company, we make long-term decisions,
we have long-term liabilities – investing in things
like infrastructure. In the UK, we’ve already
allocated £500 million to invest immediately in UK
infrastructure, as part of the Government’s Growth
Action Plan. We want to make business decisions
we will be proud of in 20 years time. In doing so,
we can leave a legacy for society as well.

We aim to adhere to the highest standards of
corporate governance and as a Group we have
been recognised for this. We are one of the top
global companies listed with the FTSE4Good Index
and are the only insurance company within the
UN Global Compact 100 stock index. In 2013, we
were runners up for a PwC Building Public Trust
award for our approach to the transparency of
our reporting.

Our achievements listed throughout this report are

but there is no room for complacency at Aviva. We
are looking to improve every year, to unlock our full
potential and create a legacy we are proud of.

We want to make business
decisions we will be as proud
of in 20 years’ time as we are
today. In doing so, we can leave
a legacy for society. We can be
a good ancestor.

 ll employees are required to complete annual training in the Code except in

France, where the requirement is included in employment contracts. While
our target remains at 100%, it is inevitable that not all employees will be
able to sign the Code each year due to maternity leave, sick leave etc.
Taking account of full year 2013 data excluding those on maternity leave
and long term sickness 98% of employees have signed the Code.*
Using RNPS methodology we calculate the performance of businesses relative

We have always been a business that has operated responsibly and

and helping them to make informed decisions. As the transformation of

To continue to be a successful business, we need to
be both ready – and willing – to change, adapting
to new social and economic factors in order to take
advantage of new opportunities and challenges.
As society changes, people’s needs change too.
Our customers are living longer, healthier lives, and
we need to develop the products and services that
meet their shifting needs.
Technology is moving forward too, with more
data now available to create accurate scenarios
that can inform the type of products we offer,
while the ways in which we can communicate with
our customers, and our employees, continue to
multiply in the digital age.
We manage our wider impact by focusing on
the way we treat our people and our commitment
to corporate responsibility. Together, they help us
to meet our commitment to address the issues that
are material to our employees, the environment
and the communities where we operate.

Aviva Our Wider Impact Report 2013

Our people matter
People all across Aviva make a difference – the difference between
success and failure. This is why we are focused on recognising
exceptional performance in our people, unleashing potential and
inviting collaboration – key components of our people thesis.
New values

Learning and development

Aviva has recently been through a period of change,
particularly the way in which it is structured and
organised. We know that organisational change has
had a significant impact on our people, so we are
focused on demonstrating our care and concern for
them and working to rebuild pride in Aviva.

Strong leadership is critical to any successful
business, and in 2013 15% of our senior leaders
were enrolled on our new Leadership Transitions
programme, in partnership with the Säid Business
School at the University of Oxford.

Last year we asked our employees to help us
develop new values and associated behaviours that
enable us to deliver our new purpose and shape
our culture. The new values are:
• Care more
• Kill complexity
• Never rest
• Create legacy
Our values will be reinforced throughout the
organisation not only through demonstration by
our leaders, but also by their integration into the
way we work. We will also ensure that the new
values and behaviours are communicated widely
and encourage open conversations.

A long-term view of talent is also vital to the
future of our business, so we’re making it easier
for our people to build their capabilities. In 2013
we continued to expand the benefits of standard
learning processes globally, with Ireland, Canada
and Singapore now joining the UK in the use
of a common Learning Management System.
Some 20,000 employees can now access shared
learning materials and create and track personal
development plans online.
Attracting talent
We aim to attract people who are the envy of
our industry. Throughout 2013 we revamped and
modernised our recruitment processes, harnessing
the power of social media to attract younger people
to the business, and further raise our profile.
One way we’ve done this is by refreshing our
careers site, making it easier for people to get a
feel for what it’s like to work here and the career
opportunities available.

In this report:
We’ve also better aligned our graduate and
apprentice recruitment campaigns with the
university application calendar and local schools’
outreach programmes.
Our emerging talent pipeline takes a long-term
view of the people we need to meet our future
priorities, including our apprenticeship programme.
Now in its third year, and positioned as a credible
alternative to higher education, it has proved a
huge success at improving opportunities for young
people from all backgrounds. In 2013 we took
on 17 young people, as well as increasing the
programme’s scope with new apprenticeships in
our actuarial and underwriting departments.

The Aviva apprenticeship programme
“I am ambitious and I’m looking forward to all the
opportunities I will get at Aviva. I would tell anyone who was
thinking about what they want to do after A-levels to really
consider the type of route I have taken. It’s a really viable
option to University as you still get higher qualifications.
If you’re not sure see what else is out there, I’m really glad
I did as working here suits me.” Rosie Messiha-Harlock

Diversity and inclusion

Employee engagement

Inclusivity and supporting people who think and
act differently are both essential attributes for
Aviva, as a business, to recognise its full potential.

Each year we conduct our annual employee
engagement survey, which helps us to further
understand our people and identify how we can
do more to support them. This year, among the
key findings were that the majority of our
employees understand our vision and feel safe to
speak up and challenge the way we do things.

It’s important to us, therefore, to create a
culture that respects difference and recognises
individuality. We employ more women (51%) than
men (49%), 21% of our senior management team
and subsidiary board members are female, along
with 21% of our Group Executive and 18% of the
Board. We’re committed to achieving 25% female
Board membership by the end of 2015.
In April 2014 we will have increased the percentage
of women in the Group Executive to 27% with the
addition of one female GE member.
We have also created a positive workplace for
lesbian, gay and bisexual employees, and we were
again listed on the UK’s Stonewall Workplace
Equality Index for 2014.

However, we have also seen a decline in the pride
people feel in working for Aviva. So, over the next
12 months, we intend to reverse this trend, with
an emphasis on supporting employees who have
told us they want to move their careers forward,
develop their skills and grow.
We are also focusing on ongoing, face-to-face
conversations with managers and responding to
feedback with clear actions. And we will continue
to listen to our employees through our employee
forums, where they can discuss matters impacting
the business.

We are proud to be a partner of the Living Wage

employer since 2005. Our minimum pay levels for

our suppliers to pay the Living Wage for onsite
contractors, too.

Our People business standard ensures consistency

Aviva Italy has become a member of

management, with under 7% making

Safety and wellbeing
We provide our employees with a safe and
healthy environment in which to work. We
provide a number of initiatives to help them
maintain a healthy working life, including flexible
working hours, career breaks and employee
assistance programmes.
We have also piloted a health risk assessment to
help us gain a broader insight into our employees’
wellbeing, and last year saw us ranked in the top
quartile of Business in the Community’s Workwell
benchmark, which looks at employee wellbeing in
FTSE 100 companies.

How are we performing?
We revamped and modernised our recruitment processes, and provided
improved opportunities for young people from all backgrounds including

Trust and transparency
To earn the trust of our customers, we need to be open in what
we do. We are committed to transparency, regular reporting on
our performance and progress on our strategy, and have a strict
code of business ethics that leaves no room for ambiguity.
We ask all employees to read the Business Ethics
Code each year, and in 2013 98% of employees
completed this. At Aviva in France employees are
required to abide by the Code as part of their
employment contract.
Transparent public policy
We seek to play an open, constructive and
positive role in shaping government policy, and
to ensure that companies and financial institutions
act in the long-term interest of their shareholders
and customers.
We are on the EU Transparency Register; our
number is 86270761494-62. Our political advisers
are members of the Association of Professional
Political Consultants (APPC) and comply with
its Code of Practice; in Brussels, they are also
a signatory to the European Public Affairs
Consultancies’ Association’s Professional Code of
Conduct, as well as being listed on the European
Commission’s Register of Interest Representatives.
Fighting financial crime
Financial crime costs our industry billions of pounds
every year, and leads to higher prices for our
customers. To manage this risk we have adopted a
zero tolerance approach to financial crime, bringing
together experts on fraud management, antimoney laundering and malpractice reporting across
our global business.

8

All our employees, right up to Board level, regularly
receive training on how to spot and fight financial
fraud, and we run a global reporting service that
allows employees to report malpractice in complete
confidence. All cases are referred for independent
investigation. In 2013, 27 cases reached conclusion
and four cases remain under investigation.
Access to insurance
By promoting access to insurance for all areas of
society we can dramatically increase our social and
economic impact. For instance, we invest in social
housing and have developed affordable home
contents insurance to help low-income households
access the cover they need.

In this report:
Group CEO’s letter

Our role is to ensure that customers feel
secure in their purchase decisions and confident
that the product they have chosen meets their
needs. This means making sure that our products,
services and communications are simple and
transparent, and enable customers to feel in
control of their financial future. This means
we must demonstrate we understand them as
individuals, and deliver products and solutions
that are personalised to them.

One of the most important ways through which
we understand our customers and what they think
of our products and services is our Relationship
Net Promoter Score® (RNPS) survey. We carry out
this survey twice a year and use the results to drive
action planning for improvement.

Governance and risk
Assurance

This year’s RNPS results show that 31% of our
markets are outperforming the market average
(ranked in the upper quartile). Our strategic plan of
action is vital to achieving our ambition of meeting
customer needs better than our competitors, so
that Aviva becomes the insurer of choice.

Caring more for our customers
We help protect customers from the financial
impact of unforeseen events and help them save
for a more secure future. Our purpose is to make
a difference for our customers by removing fear of
uncertainty, so that they are free to lead their lives.
Historically the relationship between customers and
insurance companies has at times lacked trust, with
the challenge being levelled that insurers don’t
understand or care about customers’ lives or needs.
Products and communications are viewed as overly
complicated, with customers seeing little tangible
difference between the products and services
available from different companies.

Our Business Ethics Code
•	Fair business practices with ALL our customers, employees
and suppliers.
• Transparent and honest business practices.
• Respecting confidential information we’re given.
• Obeying the rule of law.
• 	Accurate and honest reporting to our stakeholders.
• 	Respecting the environment and communities in which we work.

Human rights
We believe that respecting human rights should
be a natural part of a company’s decision-making
process, not just a policy document. We are
working to embed human rights into our business
culture, our procedures and the way in which
we operate.

We have aligned our policies and practices –
including those covering climate change and the
environment – with the principles of several key
bodies, including the UN Universal Declaration
of Human Rights and the International Labour
Organization’s (ILO) core labour standards.

During 2013 we refreshed our human rights policy in line with the UN Guiding Principles for
Business and Human Rights. It was a process that allowed us to pinpoint how we manage our
most material human rights risks in relation to our five key stakeholder groups.

We fully support the Convention on Cluster
Munitions and we do not invest in companies that
manufacture cluster munitions for policyholder and
shareholder funds.

our business, and make sure that the risks don’t
become uninsurable.
To help do this we are matching up our expert
historical knowledge of weather events with the
latest cutting-edge technology to create predictive
models of future scenarios. These are helping us
to reduce risk and ensure we can continue to offer
our customers the policies they need.
In 2013, for example, Canada suffered two ‘onein-100-year’ flood events within just two months
of each other. But thanks to our approach to risk
management, we were ready to respond quickly,
delivering the services and making the payments
our customers so desperately needed.

Green products

Materiality and stakeholder
engagement

We are progressively building environmental
considerations into our products, with a whole range
of innovative new policies. Take fire damage – where
possible, we now aim to clean and deodorise items
in situ rather than removing items and potentially
replacing them, which means fewer goods go
to waste. We are also using new techniques for
removing stains from carpets, saving our customers
the hassle of the replacement process, and cutting
the associated carbon footprint.

What are we doing?

We’ve introduced ‘parts harvesting’ for laptop
repairs too, saving usable parts from computers that
are beyond economical repair, so they can be used
as replacement parts in subsequent repairs.
In Canada, Aviva customers can take advantage
of Green Assure, which gives them the option
of replacing damaged goods with more energyefficient, environmentally friendly ones.

What are we doing?

ClimateCare
Through our work with ClimateCare, we
supported two projects in 2011 and 2012
which, in their different ways, helped
improve people’s health; reducing exposure
to dangerous smoke from wood burning
fires, and to water-borne diseases.
In Kenya we have helped over 200,000
people by supplying gravity water filters,
which means they no longer have to light
a fire to boil water before they can use it.
In India, where 82% of the population
cooks using inefficient open fires, we were
shocked to learn that indoor air pollution
from the fires causes a staggering 480,000
deaths a year. We are now subsidising the
cost of new clean energy stoves, which
produce around 80% less emissions making them affordable to more families
all over India.

Controlling our impacts
We are conscious of our own environmental impacts
as a business, too, so we are working to improve
energy efficiency across the whole Group, investing
in the low-carbon economy and addressing the
indirect impacts from our assets.
We publish our performance data for CO2e
emissions, waste and water consumption each
year, and also use Accounting for Sustainability’s
connected reporting framework to demonstrate
the cost of our environmental sustainability.
When it comes to reducing our own carbon
emissions, we have set ourselves an ambitious
target. Our aim is to cut CO2e emissions by
20% between 2010 and 2020, with a minimum
5% reduction each year. And we are on track to
achieve this, having cut our emissions by 8%
last year. Our emissions levels are 12% lower
than in 2010.

Of course, some carbon emissions are unavoidable,
and we work with our business partner
ClimateCare to offset these. We buy carbon
credits, at the rate of one per tonne of carbon that
we have emitted, from carbon finance projects
supporting sustainable projects in communities in
developing countries.

Community development
It’s part of our legacy to be community-minded. Last year
we invested £6.2 million supporting and developing local
communities, as well as being there when our 30 million
customers needed us.
We are now looking to extend the reach of
our work, focusing on the issues that are most
important to our customers, and the areas where
our skills and expertise can have the greatest
positive impact.
Employee participation
Volunteering is one of the most important ways
in which we work with our communities – and it’s
also a great way for our people to develop and
refine some of their own business skills.
We encourage all our employees to take up to
three days volunteering leave a year, and in 2013
27% of our employees took part. This means that
together they contributed more than 41,000 hours
of their time.
Our staff give generously, too. Last year 27% of
employees donated over £536,000 through our
payroll scheme. In the UK this helped us to achieve
the UK Government’s payroll-giving Gold Standard
award. In fact, 41% of employees are directly
involved in CR activities in the UK.

12

Supporting street children
Street to School, our global community
programme, is active across most of the countries
in which we operate. The idea is simple: every
child should have access to education, because
we believe education is insurance for a better
life. Since its launch in 2010 we have helped over
800,000 street-connected children.
During 2013, we worked with our partners to
develop more sustainable, lasting outcomes, and
find new ways of helping more people to work
together on behalf of street children. We continued
to focus on all important advocacy, too. We held
a reception at 10 Downing Street, hosted by
Samantha Cameron, to raise awareness of the fact
that in the UK one child runs away from home
every five minutes; we are also working with Plan
UK in Indonesia and the Indonesian Government
to help support a change in policy that increases
access to birth registration.
In addition, we held a round-table event in South
East Asia involving the UN, governments, NGOs,
businesses and academics. The key focus of the
conversation was how we can act together to
protect and promote the rights of children living
and/or working on the street. We wanted to create
a global community in support of the cause, and
as a result of our social media campaign, over a
million people followed the event.

to 128.

Working with others
In 2013 we continued to work with a diverse range
of partners, including NGOs, businesses, public
sector bodies and international organisations. We
use these connections to bring together different
skills and points of view, so that we can start to
develop new ways of tackling a range of issues all
over the world.
In the UK, a lot of our efforts are geared towards
helping parents and young people. Our work with
the charity Railway Children revolves around raising
awareness of the issue and young runaways. In
2013 we gave over £437k through donations
and fundraising.

What are we doing?

Street children in Indonesia
In Indonesia we have joined forces with

some of the 4,300 street children in Jakarta
to obtain their birth certificates. It’s a small
act, but one which will dramatically improve
their access to school and healthcare.

In 2013, we also supported the Mumsnet website,

information and advice to parents about runaway
children, and the warning signs to look out for.

Our work with bereavement specialists Grief
Encounter raises awareness of the importance of
life assurance to parents. We know it is a difficult
subject, but we want to show that in the event of a
parent dying, this protection will help address many
financial worries, allowing the surviving parent to
concentrate on helping their children to cope
with the loss.

How are we performing?
More than a quarter of our employees now take part in volunteering, although the
hours they spent doing so were reduced due to our increased focus on individual
skills-based volunteering, rather than team events, and also a significant reduction
in headcount. There were also reductions in overall community donations and
investments in ‘Street to School’ as a consequence of the sale of our US business
and the completion of our UK Athletics sponsorship, even though we exceeded
our target of 50% of cash donations. Overall, over three-quarters of employees
believe Aviva does a good job contributing to local communities.

Responsible investment

Group CEO’s letter
KPIs

We aim to invest in a responsible and sustainable way, encouraging
transparency, more sustainable business practices and good governance
in the companies we invest in. This benefits our customers, by identifying
and reducing environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks in our
holdings, and in many cases benefits society and the broader economy
by promoting more sustainable companies.

Our commitment
We are a founding signatory to the UN Principles
for Responsible Investment (PRI) and among
the first asset managers in the world to work
towards integrating material ESG issues into
all our investment decisions.
An important element of our approach to
responsible investment is upholding our rights
and responsibilities as shareholders. We were in
the vanguard of signatories to the UK Stewardship
Code, which sets out a number of areas of good
practice for asset owners to protect and enhance
the value of our shareholdings on behalf of
our customers.
As part of our commitment to responsible
investment, in 2001 we incorporated our assessment
of a company’s performance and disclosure on
corporate responsibility issues into the way we vote
– one of the first asset managers in the world to
do so, and still among a limited number.
By focusing on the long-term issues, and
encouraging companies to place sustainability
and good governance at the centre of their
strategy and operations, we create a legacy for our
customers and the communities and environment
in which we live and work.

What are we doing?

Milestone for UN Sustainable Stock Exchanges
Aviva is a long-standing champion of the idea that companies should be more
transparent about their sustainability performance. It is one of the reasons why we
played such a prominent role in establishing the Sustainable Stock Exchange (SSE) in
2009, which is now run in partnership with four United Nations-backed organisations.

The SSE promotes sustainable capital markets. It also explores how stock exchanges can
work together with investors, regulators and companies on environmental, social and
corporate governance issues, and encourages long-term approaches to investment.
Last year the SSE received a huge boost when the New York Stock Exchange’s (NYSE)
parent company Euronext signed up to the initiative. It joined existing partners NASDAQ,
BOVESPA (of Brazil) and the exchanges in India and Thailand. UN Secretary-General
Ban Ki-moon attended a ceremony to announce the deal in July, along with Dr Steve
Waygood, our Chief Responsible Investment Officer.

Supporting the transition to
a low-carbon economy
Climate change is a key challenge for society
and our economy, and a strategic issue for Aviva,
offering opportunities as well as challenges. We
support the growth of a low-carbon economy, and
invest in the infrastructure that is needed to start
making that transition.
During 2013 we made a major commitment
to solar power, installing photovoltaic systems in
over 7000 commercial and residential properties
around the UK.

We backed this up with a £36 million investment
in a new energy centre at Addenbrooke’s Hospital
in Cambridge.
We have spearheaded a number of initiatives
designed to address some of the issues that
are undermining the transition to a low-carbon
economy. These include helping to establish
the Carbon Disclosure Project’s Carbon Action
Initiative, which encourages companies to commit
to making annual reductions in their emissions,
and co-founding the Sustainable Stock
Exchange Initiative.

Independent Limited Assurance Report
to the Directors of Aviva plc
The Directors of Aviva plc (“Aviva”) engaged us to provide limited assurance on the
information described in Aviva’s Wider Impact Report for the year ending
31 December 2013.
Our conclusion
Based on the procedures we have performed
and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has
come to our attention that causes us to believe
that the Selected Information for the year ended
31 December 2013 has not been prepared, in all
material respects, with the Reporting Criteria.
This conclusion is to be read in the context of
what we say below.
Selected Information
The scope of our work was limited to assurance
over the information marked with the symbol
in Aviva’s Wider Impact Report 2013 (the “Selected
Information” as found on pages 3 and 4).
The Selected Information was assessed against the
Reporting Criteria found at http://www.aviva.com/
corporate-responsibility/reports/ 1. Our assurance
does not extend to information in respect of earlier
periods or to any other information included in
Aviva’s Wider Impact Report 2013.

Professional standards applied and
level of assurance
We performed a limited assurance engagement
in accordance with International Standard on
Assurance Engagements 3000 – ‘Assurance
engagements other than Audits or Review of
Historical Financial Information’ (ISAE 3000) and,
in respect of CO2 emissions, the International
Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 –
‘Assurance engagements on greenhouse gas
statements’ (ISAE 3410) issued by the International
Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. A limited
assurance engagement is substantially less in
scope than a reasonable assurance engagement
in relation to both the risk assessment procedures,
including an understanding of internal control,
and the procedures performed in response to the
assessed risks.
Our independence and quality control
We applied the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW)
Code of Ethics, which includes independence
and other requirements founded on fundamental
principles of integrity, objectivity, professional
competence and due care, confidentiality and
professional behaviour.

We apply International Standard on Quality Control
(UK&I) and accordingly maintain a comprehensive
system of quality control including documented
policies and procedures regarding compliance with
ethical requirements, professional standards and
applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

Our work was carried out by an independent

and assurance.
Understanding reporting and
measurement methodologies
The Selected Information needs to be read and
understood together with the Reporting Criteria.
The absence of a significant body of established
practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure
non-financial information allows for different,
but acceptable, measurement techniques. The
nature, methods and precision used to determine
non-financial information can result in materially
different measurements, affecting comparability
between entities and over time. The Reporting
Criteria used for the reporting of the Selected
Information are at 31 December 2013.

1 The maintenance and integrity of Aviva’s website is the responsibility of the Directors; the work carried out by us does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, we accept no responsibility for any changes that may have
occurred to the reported Selected Information or Reporting Criteria when presented on Aviva’s website.
