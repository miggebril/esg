Community Development
RBC™ is consistently recognized as one of Canada’s
leading corporate citizens, thanks to our philanthropy,
community development and environmental programs,
and the involvement of our employees.

Goal and overview
The goal of our community development and
environmental programs is to have a positive and
measurable impact on the communities where we live,
and on the health of the planet. We have five activities
that fall into this category:
 Donations to registered charities as gifts, without the
expectation of an economic return.
 	Community investments, such as gifts in-kind
(including philanthropic activities other than charitable
donations).
 Sponsorships that align with our brand and business
goals, and/or deliver social, environmental or economic
benefit.
 	Volunteer efforts of employees and retirees with
financial support from RBC for their charitable partners
and other employee activities in support of community
development.

 A
 rts and culture – Donations to arts organizations of all
kinds, with a focus on providing support to emerging
artists, and helping them bridge the gap from academic
success to professional achievement.
 Environment – Donations to organizations to promote
environmental sustainability, with a focus on projects
that protect water in urban or urbanized areas.
 	Sports and civic engagement – Donations to
organizations that support amateur sports from
grassroots programs to elite athletes competing at the
Olympic Games; and donations to organizations that
support community economic development, citizenship
and newcomers to Canada.

Total charitable donations – 2013
We donated $55.7 million to registered charities in Canada.
In accordance with our commitment to Imagine Canada’s
Caring Company Program, we invest a minimum of 1 per
cent of pre-tax domestic profits in support of charitable
and non-profit endeavours in Canada.1

charitable sectors. We provide deeper and more significant
support for key causes we believe are important to our
clients, businesses and employees.

 Education – Donations to organizations that offer
educational programs for all ages. In Canada, our
education focus is on providing support for after school
programs.
 Health – Donations to hospitals and other health care
centres in support of our vision to help create healthy
communities. Our primary focus is on providing support
for children’s mental health programs.

RBC Children’s Mental Health Project to support
community-based and hospital programs that reduce

and well-being of the thousands of families with
seriously ill children staying at the 14 Ronald McDonald
Houses across Canada each year.

Wallaceburg, Ontario to provide youth with an
opportunity to improve their social well-being through
cultural teachings, education and recreation. The
program provides youth with the necessary skills to be

 $
 3.1 million to 146 organizations through
the RBC Emerging Artists Project to support
apprenticeships, internships and artist recognition
programs that bridge the gap from academic excellence
to professional careers across a range of visual, literary
and performing arts.
	For example, we provided $100,000 to the National
Ballet of Canada for the RBC Apprentice Programme,
which produces graduates that fill the ranks of
respected dance companies around the world.

Philanthropic activities other than charitable donations
In 2013, we contributed $6.9 million to community
investment activities in Canada. This included our support
for employee volunteerism, contributions to non-profit
organizations that are not registered charities, gifts inkind, community sponsorships, community economic
development and community investment program
management.
Examples of our Canadian community investments in 2013:
 W
 e committed to providing $1 million over four years to
the My Giving Moment campaign, made possible by the
Rideau Hall Foundation. Launched in 2013, this fouryear social media campaign encourages all Canadians
to give back to their communities through donations of
time, talent or money.
 W
 e provided $50,000 to the Centre for the North as
part of a $250,000 five-year commitment. The Centre
for the North is an initiative of the Conference Board of
Canada. Its goal is to bring government, business and
community, and Aboriginal leaders together to achieve
a shared vision of sustainable prosperity in the North.
 W
 e provided $12,500 to support the RBC Top 25
Canadian Immigrant Awards. These awards recognize
the achievements and accomplishments of Canadian
immigrants.
For examples of employee volunteer efforts, see page 5.

Sponsorships
We provide significant support to community organizations
and charities through sponsorships. Sponsorships are
negotiated and undertaken for strategic marketing purposes
that align with our brand and business goals. They are
expected to deliver a quantifiable return on investment, and
some also benefit organizations and causes that provide
social, environmental or economic benefit.
Examples of our Canadian sponsorships with a social
impact in 2013:
 W
 e partnered with Free The Children on the “We Create
Change” penny drive. The drive encouraged children
and their schools to collect pennies in support of Free
The Children’s year-long Water Initiative. A total of
140 million pennies ($1.4 million) were collected from
across Canada, providing clean water to 56,000 people
living in Free The Children international project areas.

 W
 e were a national co-title sponsor of We Day 2013,
an initiative of Free The Children. We Days allow youth
to engage on social and environmental issues they are
passionate about, and help to build a movement of
young people making a difference in their communities
and around the world. RBC helped bring We Day to
nine cities across Canada between April and November
2013. These events were attended by over 120,000
Canadian youth and their teachers.
 W
 e have been Canada’s longest-standing supporter
of the Canadian Olympic Team with a relationship
dating back to 1947. We are proudly continuing our
sponsorship at the Sochi 2014 and Rio 2016 Olympic
Games. In addition, we support amateur sport in
communities across Canada, from recreational to
competitive activities, and from grassroots to elite-level
athletes.
 W
 e provide elite-level athletes with flexible career
experiences to complement their training regimes
through the RBC Olympians program. Since its
inception, nearly 200 current and retired Olympic
and Paralympic athletes have participated in the RBC
Olympians program, and more than 10 have become
full-time RBC employees.

Employees and community development
RBC employees and retirees are passionate volunteers,
and we have a number of programs to support their efforts.

Grant programs
We support individual and team volunteer efforts, including
disaster relief clean-up activities, for our employees and
retirees through two specific grant programs:

need, undertaken outside working hours. In 2013, we
donated $530,000 on behalf of 524 teams in Canada
participating in the program.

Examples of employee activities
RBC employees in Canada volunteered with many
organizations in 2013, including United Way, Junior
Achievement, Free The Children (We Day) and Habitat for
Humanity. Other examples include:
 1
 6,000 employees in towns and cities across Canada
took part in RBC Blue Water Community Makeovers,
planting over 11,000 plants and collecting more than
1,500 bags of garbage.
 M
 ore than 300 employees dedicated more than 5,600
hours to help those affected by the flooding in southern
Alberta. RBC donated $114,000 to the Canadian Red
Cross – Alberta Floods Fund on their behalf (in addition
to a corporate gift of $125,000).
Our employees also participated in various activities in
support of community development. For example, 3,500
employees, friends and family members in Canada took
part in the RBC Run for the Kids. The event raised over
$1.2 million in support of youth mental health services for
Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto.

Community economic development through financial
products and services
Banks play an important role in society by efficiently
channeling funds to help create and grow wealth. We
provide credit and other financial services to projects that
contribute to the economic development of communities,
generate social and environmental benefits and provide
financial returns.

 R
 BC Employee Volunteer Grants (for individuals) –
When an RBC employee or retiree donates 40 hours
or more of their time over the course of the year to a
registered charity, we provide that organization with
a $500 grant to celebrate our volunteer. In 2013,
we donated more than $1 million to community
organizations on behalf of 2,090 employees and
retirees in Canada.

 Community infrastructure – We provide financing and
advice to clients in order to build infrastructure such
as hospitals, schools, community centres, roads,
bridges, energy and transit systems, and other major
community-building projects. These clients include
corporations, municipalities, First Nations and privatepublic partnerships (PPPs).

 R
 BC Day of Service Grants (for teams) – Volunteer
teams of six or more people – three of whom must be
RBC employees – can apply for a $1,000 RBC grant
to their chosen charity in recognition of their group
responding to a one-time or short-term community

 Innovation – We provide financing and advice to
knowledge-based industry clients in the information
technology, life sciences and health care, media
and entertainment sectors. We also sponsor and
support programs that promote the development and
commercialization of new ideas.
2013 RBC Public Accountability Statement   5

 Sustainability – We provide financing and advice to
for-profit companies that are focused on tackling social
and environmental challenges in our communities while
generating a financial return. For example, the RBC
Generator is a $10 million pool of capital we created
for the purpose of making “social finance” investments
in businesses with strong potential to deliver both
long-term financial returns and positive benefits in
one or more of the following strategic areas: energy,
water, employment for youth and community hiring/
employment for disadvantaged groups.

Initiatives to Support Small
Businesses and Micro-Credit
Every day, we serve small business clients through the
provision of credit, advice, specialized products and
services. They, in turn, create jobs, pay taxes, buy goods
and services, and contribute to a prosperous Canada.

Small business
In 2013, we:
 L aunched new resources to help our account managers

portfolio by improving processes so we can provide
readier access to credit and faster service for clients.

Micro-credit
RBC does not have a formal micro-credit product or
program as it would typically be defined. However, for the
purposes of this report, we are interpreting “micro-credit”
as a variation on traditional credit that involves providing
very small loans to people who would otherwise be unable
to secure credit. These people might be unemployed or
underemployed, lack collateral or an acceptable credit
history. We provide small loans to entrepreneurs, support
newcomers to Canada and work with underserved
communities to support educational programs, create jobs
and promote prosperity.
Examples:
 T hrough our Skilled Immigrant Employment Loan
Program, we offer newcomers the opportunity to receive
a loan of up to $10,000 to put towards certification
and/or licensing in Canada. In 2013, this pilot program
was expanded to include 67 RBC Royal Bank™ branches
in the Greater Toronto Area, 14 in Vancouver and 20 in
Montreal. This program helps newcomers who work in
the skilled trades, many of whom want to further their
education to re-certify or upgrade their skills in Canada.
 W
 e are involved in a pilot project in cooperation with the
non-profit ACCESS Community Capital Fund, whereby
RBC provides and administers micro-loans to residents
of Toronto’s Regent Park community so they can finance
new and existing small businesses in the area.
