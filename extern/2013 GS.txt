Environmental overview
At Goldman Sachs, we have long recognized that a healthy environment is the foundation for economic progress and is essential to
the well-being of society. As a leading financial institution, we are committed to finding market solutions that benefit the environment.
Our commitment to environmental sustainability encompasses each of our businesses, whether it is deploying capital to expand clean
energy solutions or forging innovative public-private partnerships that strengthen water infrastructures. A prerequisite and necessary
complement to these core business activities is a commitment to minimizing our own environmental impact. Through the Center for
Environmental Markets, we have partnerships with non-governmental organizations to research and conduct pilot projects that can
help inform public policy and accelerate financial solutions for the environment.
Our tradition of environmental stewardship was formalized in 2005, when we established the Environmental Policy Framework. While
aspects of the Framework have evolved over time, we remain committed to its core tenet: committing our people, capital and ideas
to develop market solutions to address environmental challenges. Our Environmental Markets Group coordinates and oversees our
Framework, while respective business units execute on the commitments and contribute to environmental progress. Our Board of
Directors reviews the Framework and the Corporate Governance, Nominating and Public Responsibilities Committee of the Board
reviews environmental, social and governance issues affecting the firm, including through the periodic review of the ESG Report.
The following provides key highlights of our ongoing progress. To read a more detailed summary of our environmental policies,
practices and initiatives, please visit www.gs.com/environment.

OUR Business Initiatives
Each of our business areas has an important role to play in implementing our
commitments under the Environmental Policy Framework and contributing
to environmental progress. For example, our Investment Banking and
Investment and Lending businesses help provide capital and advice to advance
environmentally responsible projects and transactions. Investment Management
incorporates an understanding of environmental impacts and capabilities into
our efforts to manage and preserve the assets of our clients. Through our Global
Investment Research Division, we integrate environmental, social and other
relevant factors into our fundamental analysis of individual companies and
industry sectors.

Clean Energy

A key role we play in the transition toward a low-carbon future is assisting
clients to meet their capital needs in developing clean energy solutions. As part
of our longstanding commitment, in 2012 we set a goal to target $40 billion in
capital toward clean technology and renewables over the coming decade. Last
year, we made significant progress toward meeting this goal with more than
$11 billion in financing and co-investments. We also served as financial advisor
on clean energy mergers and acquisitions transactions valued at more than
$1 billion. For more information, please see our Environmental Markets page.
Below are highlights of recent transactions:
•

Yield Vehicles
Goldman Sachs demonstrated its innovative approach within this emerging
asset class when we led the initial public offering of NRG Yield, a first-of-itskind business in the U.S. that is focused on satisfying the country’s growing
need for power in an environmentally responsible manner. NRG Yield consists
predominantly of renewable and gas-fired generation capacity that has been
contracted over the longterm by its utility customers. Goldman Sachs served
as active book runner in NRG Yield’s $495 million initial public offering, priced
in July 2013.

Smart Grid
In March 2013, we served as lead book runner on the $93 million initial public
offering for Silver Spring Networks. Silver Spring Networks provides a leading
networking platform and other solutions that enable utilities to transform a
power grid infrastructure into a smart grid. Its technology connects millions of
devices that generate, control, monitor and consume power. These networks
provide a wealth of data that enables utilities to enhance efficiency, increase
reliability and automate manual services, including meter reading. They also
enable households to monitor their own energy use and make adjustments, if
needed, during times of expensive peak demand. The oversubscription of the
offering suggests investors’ deep interest in market leaders focused on the
modernization of electrical grids.

•

Wind
In August 2013, we assisted China Longyuan Power Group, the leading wind power operator in Asia and second-largest globally, to
successfully issue a three-year, 3.25 percent $300 million bond. The proceeds of the transaction will be used to develop and expand
the company’s renewable energy businesses, as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes. China Longyuan
Power is playing an important role in China’s endeavor to diversify its energy mix and meet its growing energy needs by expanding
renewable energy.

•

Electric Vehicles
In February 2014, we managed a $2 billion convertible notes offering for Tesla, a manufacturer of high-performance, fully electric
vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. The offering was significantly oversubscribed and represented
the largest convertible debt transaction since 2010. In May 2013, we helped raise over $1 billion in new financing for the company,
which enabled Tesla to repay the entire loan that it had received from the U.S. Department of Energy in 2010, nine years earlier than
it was due. This was the sixth equity or equity-linked offering we have led for the company, including acting as an underwriter on its
initial public offering in 2010.

•

Renewable Oils
We continue to strengthen our relationship with Solazyme, a global market leader in the design and production of sustainable algal
oils and bioproducts. In January 2013, we served as a book runner on Solazyme’s $125 million convertible debt offering. Proceeds of
the transaction will be used to fund the company’s growth objectives. This was the second transaction we have worked on with the
company. We served as a book runner on their initial public offering in 2011.

Water

Extreme weather, aging water infrastructure systems and growing demand have made water needs more acute, while increasingly
constrained government funding has made meeting the infrastructure needs more challenging. We seek to help communities meet
their capital requirements to address these infrastructure needs through financing innovative solutions. In July 2013, Goldman
Sachs acted as sole book runner in the issuance of $308 million of Lehigh County Authority Water and Sewer Revenue bonds (City of
Allentown Concession). The bonds were issued to finance the upfront payment required to lease the water and sewer system from the
City of Allentown, Pennsylvania, and pre-fund the system’s five-year Capital Improvement Program. As consideration for the upfront
payment, the city granted a 50-year concession allowing Lehigh County Authority to operate the system. This innovative transaction
resulted in a more regionally managed water system for Lehigh County.

Green Bonds

Increasing interest from investors has created opportunities for environmentally beneficial projects to raise capital in the fixed income
markets. Green Bonds are debt financings in which proceeds are exclusively directed toward green purposes. In February 2014, we
acted as joint book runner on Unibail-Rodamco’s €750 million green bond issuance. Unibail-Rodamco is a pan-European commercial
property operator, investor and developer. Proceeds will be used to finance the construction and development of new and existing
eligible assets, as certified by BREEAM, a leading global design and assessment method for sustainable buildings. This transaction
marks the first green bond issued by a corporation in 2014 and the first ever for a real estate company in the Euro market.

Global Investment Research

As part of our Global Investment Research Division, we integrate environmental, social and other relevant factors into our fundamental
analysis of individual companies and industry sectors. We believe that understanding environmental risks and business opportunities
leads to a more comprehensive investment analysis. For more information on environmental, social and governance research, please
view our Global Investment Research page.

Goldman Sachs Asset Management

With environmental issues at the forefront of investors’ minds, certain investment teams in Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM)
continue to increase the formal integration of environmental, social and governance research. For more information on GSAM, please
visit our Governance page.

ENVIRONMENTAL RISK MANAGEMENT
We approach the management of environmental risks with the same care and
discipline as any other business risk. In doing so, we facilitate more responsible
capital deployment.
The responsibility of conducting due diligence and environmental risk
management lies with each of our business teams and employees. The
Environmental Markets Group assists transaction teams by providing guidance
on environmental issues, and, as appropriate, performing independent reviews
and recommending ways to reduce risks. We also have various committees that
oversee our business selection decisions and risk management. For example,
our Physical Commodities Review Committee, which is a cross-divisional firmwide governance committee, ensures that we have a consistent approach to
evaluating and managing environmental, health and safety risks in our physical
commodities activities. In highly sensitive sectors and for investments, we also
leverage the expertise of our internal consulting team, Corporate Environmental
Management, which includes staff with strong environmental expertise.
In 2013, 273 transactions were reviewed by the Environmental Markets
Group and over 600 new employees received environmental and social risk
management training.
For more information, please see our Business Selection and Environmental
Advisory process.

Environmental Markets Group
Part of the Executive Office and reports to the Office of the Chairman. It
works closely with transaction teams on enhanced deal reviews to ensure
the environmental impacts of our clients and transactions are factored into
business selection decisions.
CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
Part of the Finance Division and includes staff with technical
environmental expertise. Corporate Environmental Management applies its
technical expertise to investments and transactions that have potentially
high environmental sensitivity.

Our OPERATIONAL IMPACT
With the July 2013 Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold
certification for the refurbishment of our Melbourne office, more than 50 percent
of the firm’s global real estate portfolio (more than 5.2 million square feet) has
now achieved LEED certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. The
Goldman Sachs LEED portfolio now extends to six offices, with six additional
projects in the pipeline for LEED or an equivalent certification. Other recent
certifications include offices in London and Dubai, highlighting the global reach
of the firm’s efforts. Earlier this year, the São Paulo office received LEED’s highest
rating of Platinum, making it the firm’s first LEED Platinum commercial interiors
space and the first LEED Platinum commercial interiors project in Latin America.
We continue to make progress toward our goal to be carbon neutral across
our facilities by 2020. Our Carbon Reduction Framework challenges us to
be innovative in the design, construction and operation of our facilities and
technology to maximize efficiency. An example of such innovation is our
recent public-private lighting collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy,
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Green Light New York to improve
energy efficiency in our global headquarters. The Living Lab project consists of
the retrofit of lighting, daylighting, shading and control systems on an occupied
office floor, with the goal of analyzing and implementing new technologies that
dramatically reduce energy use and costs, and significantly improve the interior
environment for the occupants. The technologies with the greatest potential for
widespread replication will be considered for wider use throughout our global
real estate portfolio and made available to the design, construction and real
estate communities.

PARTNERSHIPS AND ENGAGEMENT
Center for Environmental Markets

Through the Center for Environmental Markets, we collaborate with corporations, academic institutions and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) to research and develop market-based solutions to environmental challenges. We have a number of research
and pilot project partnerships to help inform public policy and promote financial solutions to address environmental challenges.

Conferences

We continue to host and participate in major conferences attended by policy makers, NGOs and academic institutions, as well as
Goldman Sachs clients, investors and employees.
In February 2014, we hosted a summit to explore innovative financing and capital market solutions which benefit the environment. For
more information, please see Environmental Finance Innovation Summit.
In September 2013, we hosted the annual Investment Banking Division Clean Energy Ecosystem Summit, which brought together
leaders in the clean energy field: startups; global energy, technology and industrial companies; investors; NGOs; universities;
environmental organizations; and federal, state and local officials.
In February 2013, we hosted a summit on Water: Emerging Risks & Opportunities, in partnership with the World Resources Institute and
General Electric.

Employee Engagement

One way we raise awareness of environmental issues is through our internal speaker series. For example, in recognition of Earth Day,
the firm hosted a series of global events to engage employees on topics relating to global renewable energy generation and carbon
reduction. These events convened more than 1,500 employees around the world.
We publish periodic environmental newsletters updating employees on notable transactions related to the environment, the firm’s
progress on mitigating our environmental footprint and policy updates, among other topics.
Employee-led environmental networks in cities around the world raise awareness and engage local employees on initiatives ranging
from recycling to composting to reduction of disposable cups and bottles.
During 2013, Goldman Sachs employees participated in 245 Community TeamWorks volunteer projects in their local communities that
had a direct impact on the environment.
