Message from Steven A. Kandarian
Chairman, President & CEO of MetLife, Inc.

“MetLife is committed to
being a world-class company
in everything it does.
With the repositioning of
MetLife Foundation, we
are now pursuing a worldclass philanthropic goal –
strengthening the financial
capabilities of underserved
populations around the world.”

“This was an ambitious and exciting
year for MetLife Foundation as we
expanded the reach of our work and
made significant strides toward our
new goal of ensuring financial inclusion
for people in need around the globe.”
We believe in the transformative power of
affordable, convenient financial services, and
we have already begun to see the impact
that our new focus can have. Thanks to the
efforts of our partners, we are helping to
build a more secure future for low-income
individuals, families and communities.

improved savings outcomes for low- and
moderate-income communities in the U.S.

The following pages detail our contributions
for this year and highlight steps taken toward
our ambitious commitment of $200 million
to financial inclusion over the next five years.
Among our first round of initiatives is a
global educational partnership with Sesame
Workshop. This partnership, to which we’ve
made a five-year, $20 million commitment,
will allow us to reach close to 75 million
young families.

With sustained commitment to our mission
and our partners, MetLife Foundation
looks confidently to a future where people
everywhere have the financial tools to
achieve their dreams and pursue more from
life. As always, we welcome your ideas,
insights and support as we bring our vision
to life.

We have also partnered with the Corporation
for Enterprise Development on an actionresearch project to test strategies for

Why Financial Inclusion?
MetLife Foundation Believes:

Our Vision
Is Based on Three
Powerful Pillars

Our financial support has a role to play in
bringing the organizations that serve low-income
communities together with fellow innovators in
technology and product development to deliver
quality, affordable financial services.

Access to Knowledge

In collaboration with our not-for-profit and forprofit partners, we can deliver information and
services to underserved individuals and families
to help them manage their money reliably and
efficiently.

Access to Services

We can play a critical role as aggregators of
industry knowledge, best practices and peer
learning to ensure financial inclusion for those
who need it most.

Investing in research and
sharing what we learn with the
financial inclusion community

Creative approaches to savings and financial
services have shown tremendous success
engaging low-income communities and
putting people on the path to financial
stability. That’s why the Corporation for
Enterprise Development (CFED) is helping
six not-for-profit organizations across the U.S.
develop and test new ideas for innovative
savings products and strategies. With MetLife
Foundation support, CFED is launching a
dynamic Savings Innovation Learning Cluster,
which will use a peer learning model to help
these partners pursue common and unique
solutions that can help low-income households
achieve their financial goals.

Brazil, Mexico & Peru
Building a Safety Net
for Women and Families
Around the world, far too many women live
without a safety net to temper the hardship
of a health emergency. With support from
MetLife Foundation, Women’s World
Banking (WWB) is addressing this critical issue
by developing new affordable health insurance
products. In Peru, WWB created a hospital
cash policy for women that will launch in
2014, and the organization is currently
developing another new product based on a
MetLife Foundation-funded feasibility study
in Mexico. WWB will take the findings from
these projects and expand its work throughout
Latin America and into Africa and the Middle
East.

Pro Mujer
Mexico
Expanding Financial Services
in Oaxaca
Over 23 years, Pro Mujer has educated
and empowered more than 1.5 million Latin
American women, developing a proven model
that combines financial services, business
training and healthcare. MetLife Foundation
has funded the opening of Pro Mujer’s new
Neighborhood Center in Oaxaca, contributing
to the creation of 35 communal banks.
Along with financial services, the Center will
provide management training and healthcare
initiatives such as glucose testing and nutrition
counseling, helping women in Mexico’s
second poorest state build healthier, more
secure lives for themselves and their families.

Educating and Empowering
the Ultra-Poor
Trickle Up has been remarkably successful
in helping those earning less than $1.25 a
day take the first steps out of poverty. Their
programs, which combine seed capital grants,
skills training and mentoring, lift households
up and help to break the multi-generational
cycle of poverty. With support from MetLife
Foundation, Trickle Up is implementing its
graduation model—a staged process that
helps women build greater skills to provide
for their economic lives—in Odisha and West
Bengal. These efforts will bring women greater
knowledge of and access to financial services,
along with useful community connections.

Financial Inclusion Landscapes and

Without adequate skills and preparation, lowincome communities struggle to take advantage
of formal financial services. Seoul Welfare
Foundation (SWF) reaches households directly
with its Family Financial Camp, an overnight
program that helps families develop financial
goals and the strategies to achieve them. With
MetLife Foundation’s support, SWF will help
18,000 low-income families establish savings
accounts and the skills and confidence to
use them effectively. They will also conduct
market research to better understand these
communities and help to develop new services
that support the financially excluded.

As one of 34 donor members of Consultative
Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), MetLife
Foundation supports both their overall mission
to improve financial services for low-income
people worldwide and a variety of special
initiatives. King Baudouin Foundation, also
a MetLife Foundation grantee, conducted initial
insights research in Russia and then launched
a partnership with CGAP to delve deeper into
the state of financial inclusion there, seeking
leverage points to create better opportunities
for low-income Russians. Leveraging grantees’
expertise and strengths develops both greater
insights for the financial inclusion field and
stronger relationships among industry peers
and professionals.

Poland
Developing Financial Skills in
Young People
Each year, JA Worldwide empowers more
than 10 million young people to own their
economic future through hands-on education
in entrepreneurship, work readiness and
financial literacy. Building on more than 30
years of collaboration, JA has now launched
the MetLife Foundation Older Youth
Development project across five countries.
In Poland, a new Entrepreneurial School is
increasing secondary school teachers’ access
to entrepreneurial resources for the classroom.
This project, along with initiatives in Russia,
Egypt, Korea and Mexico, is empowering
disadvantaged youth to take control of their
lives and succeed in the global economy.

Sesame Workshop
Sharing Financial Knowledge
With Young Families Around the World
Sesame Workshop sets the global standard for making topics like math, reading and
science accessible to young children and their families. Now—with a five-year, $20
million commitment from MetLife Foundation—Sesame Street programming will help
children and caregivers around the world become more financially capable. This new
initiative will reach close to 75 million people in up to 10 countries, starting with Brazil,
China, India and Mexico.
Expanding on their already successful partnership, Sesame Workshop and MetLife
Foundation will create targeted, multimedia programs designed to help low-income
families realize their financial goals. Content will focus on practical everyday lessons of
basic numeracy, self-regulation and key social skills that encourage financial inclusion.
MetLife Foundation and Sesame Workshop will also work to build a coalition of local
partnerships to help deliver these programs, ensuring that as many families as possible
have access to the financial knowledge and tools they need to put them on the path to
financial security.

Financial
Inclusion
Profile:
Local Initiatives Support
Corporation and Suyapa Perez
Offering dedicated financial coaching paired with creative tools,
Financial Opportunity Centers (FOCs) throughout the U.S. help clients
boost earnings, build credit and make educated financial decisions. Local
Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) is using a $2.25 million grant
from MetLife Foundation to strengthen the reach and impact of its
nationwide network of FOCs and help more low-income individuals
achieve financial stability and independence.

Suyapa Perez is a 51-year-old mother of three
and the wife of, in her words, “an honorable
and hard-working man.” When Perez emigrated
with her family from Honduras in 2000, she
left behind a career as a primary school teacher,
but after arriving in the U.S., she could only
find work cleaning or doing menial tasks in
restaurant kitchens.

In April 2013, Perez came to Boston’s CONNECT
FOC, where she worked with a financial coach
to document a budget, finding that household
expenses far exceeded income and that she and
her husband were incurring credit card debt to
make ends meet. She worked on her finances
in the context of her goals, which included
becoming a minister and seeing her children
graduate from college in the U.S.

6.

CorporateRegister.com Limited 15-05-14

Meeting with her financial coach, Perez
learned basic money management skills, such
as savings, credit building and even how to
write a check. She then passed these skills on to
her children, bringing them to their community
bank to open accounts of their own.
In less than a year, Perez began to save nearly
$300 a month, and her family plans to be free
of credit card debt by the end of 2014. She
has said that LISC’s FOC network “allows you
to believe in yourself,” and benefits of the
FOC have empowered her whole family—her
husband started his own small business, and
two of her three children have enrolled in
college programs.

implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the
preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected
depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud

or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal
control relevant to the Foundation’s preparation and fair presentation of the
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Foundation’s internal control. Accordingly, we express
no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Foundation as of December 31,
2013 and 2012, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the years
then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

METLIFE FOUNDATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013
AND 2012
The MetLife Foundation (the “Foundation”)
was formed for the purpose of supporting
various philanthropic organizations and
activities, principally in the United States.
During 2013, the Foundation began an
initiative of devoting resources to advancing
financial inclusion, helping to build a secure
future for individuals and communities
around the world.
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The Foundation’s financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America (“GAAP”) which
recognize income when earned and expenses
when incurred.
Investments at Fair Value – The Foundation’s
equity investments are principally comprised
of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Shortterm investments include investments with
remaining maturities of one year or less, but
greater than three months, at the time of
acquisition. Related holdings gains and losses
are reported in investment income. The
Foundation is not exposed to any significant
concentration of credit risk in its investment
portfolio.
Program-Related Investments – Such
investments are authorized by the Board
of Directors and represent loans to or
equity investments in qualified charitable
organizations or investments for appropriate
charitable purposes as set forth in the
Internal Revenue Code and regulations
thereunder, and are carried at outstanding
indebtedness or cost. An allowance for
possible losses is established when the
Foundation does not expect repayment in
full on any program-related loan and when
such uncollectible amount can be reasonably
estimated. As of December 31, 2013 and

December 31, 2012, this allowance was
zero. In addition, the income generated
by the program-related loans is generally
dependent upon the financial ability of
the borrowers to keep current on their
obligations. For disclosure purposes, a
reasonable estimate of fair value was not
made since the difference between fair value
and the outstanding indebtedness or cost
would not be significant. Maturities of the
loan investments range from 2021 through
2022.
Cash Equivalents and Cash Overdraft – Cash
equivalents are highly liquid investments
purchased with an original or remaining
maturity of three months or less at the date
of purchase and are carried at fair value. The
Foundation generally invests funds required
for cash disbursements in cash equivalents
and transfers such funds to its operating
bank account when checks are presented for
payment. The cash overdrafts at December
31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 represent
grant disbursements that cleared the
operating bank account in 2014 and 2013,
respectively.
Contributions – All contributions received
to date by the Foundation have been
unrestricted and, therefore, all of its
net assets are similarly unrestricted. All
contributions received during 2013 and 2012
have been from MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries
(“MetLife”).

results could differ from these estimates.
Since the obligation to make payment
of conditional multi-year grants and
program-related loans is dependent upon
each grantee/borrower’s satisfaction of
the applicable conditions, the amount of
conditional multi-year grants and programrelated loans reported as commitments
is based upon the expected or estimated
fulfillment of such conditions.
2. FAIR VALUE
The Foundation has elected to measure its
equity investments, short-term investments
and cash equivalents at fair value with
related holdings gains and losses reported in
investment income.
When developing estimated fair values, the
Foundation considers three broad valuation
techniques: (i) the market approach, (ii)
the income approach, and (iii) the cost
approach. The Foundation determines the
most appropriate valuation technique to
use, given what is being measured and
the availability of sufficient inputs, giving
priority to observable inputs. The Foundation
categorizes its assets and liabilities measured
at estimated fair value into a three-level
hierarchy, based on the significant input with
the lowest level in its valuation. The input
levels are as follows:

Grants – Such transactions are authorized by
the Board of Directors. Conditional grants
authorized for payment in future years are
subject to further review and approval by the
Foundation.

Level 1
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities. The
Foundation defines active markets based
on average trading volume for equity
securities. The size of the bid/ask spread is
used as an indicator of market activity for
fixed maturity securities.

Estimates – The preparation of the financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual

Level 2
Quoted prices in markets that are not
active or inputs that are observable either
directly or indirectly. These inputs can
include quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities other than quoted prices in Level
1, quoted prices in markets that are not
active, or other significant inputs that are
observable or can be derived principally
13.

CorporateRegister.com Limited 15-05-14

from or corroborated by observable
market data for substantially the full term
of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3
Unobservable inputs that are supported
by little or no market activity and are
significant to the determination of
estimated fair value of the assets or
liabilities. Unobservable inputs reflect the
reporting entity’s own assumptions about
the assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability.
Financial markets are susceptible to severe
events evidenced by rapid depreciation in
asset values accompanied by a reduction in
asset liquidity. The Foundation’s ability to sell
securities, or the price ultimately realized for
these securities, depends upon the demand
and liquidity in the market and increases
the use of judgment in determining the
estimated fair value of certain securities.

Considerable judgment is often required
in interpreting market data to develop
estimates of fair value, and the use
of different assumptions or valuation
methodologies may have a material effect on
the estimated fair value amounts.

The following describes the valuation
methodologies used to measure assets
and liabilities at fair value. The description
includes the valuation techniques and key
inputs for each category of assets or liabilities
that are classified within Level 2 and Level 3
of the fair value hierarchy.
Equity Investments, Short-term Investments
and Cash Equivalents
When available, the estimated fair value
of these financial instruments is based on
quoted prices in active markets that are
readily and regularly obtainable. Generally,
these are the most liquid of the Company’s
securities holdings and valuation of these
securities does not involve management’s
judgment.
When quoted prices in active markets are not
available, the determination of estimated fair
value is based on market standard valuation
methodologies, giving priority to observable
inputs. The significant inputs to the market
standard valuation methodologies for
certain types of securities with reasonable
levels of price transparency are inputs that
are observable in the market or can be
derived principally from, or corroborated by,
observable market data. When observable
inputs are not available, the market standard
valuation methodologies rely on inputs
that are significant to the estimated fair
value that are not observable in the market
or cannot be derived principally from, or
corroborated by, observable market data.
These unobservable inputs can be based
in large part on management’s judgment
or estimation and cannot be supported by
reference to market activity. Even though
these inputs are unobservable, management
believes they are consistent with what
other market participants would use when
pricing such securities and are considered
appropriate given the circumstances.

Level 2 Valuation Techniques and Key Inputs:

Short-term investments

This level includes short-term investments
and cash equivalents priced principally
by independent pricing services using
observable inputs. These securities are
principally valued using the market
approach. Valuation is based primarily
on quoted prices in markets that are not
active or using matrix pricing or other
similar techniques using standard market
observable inputs such as benchmark U.S.
Treasury yield curve, the spread off the U.S.
Treasury yield curve for the identical security
and comparable securities that are actively
traded.

These investments are principally valued
using the market approach. Valuations are
based primarily on matrix pricing or other
similar techniques that utilize unobservable
inputs or inputs that cannot be derived
principally from, or corroborated by,
observable market data; and inputs including
quoted prices for identical or similar
securities that are less liquid and based on
lower levels of trading activity than securities
classified in Level 2. Certain valuations are
based on independent non-binding broker
quotations.
Transfers between Levels

Level 3 Valuation Techniques and Key Inputs:
In general, securities classified within Level 3
use many of the same valuation techniques
and inputs as described previously for Level 2.
However, if key inputs are unobservable, or
if the investments are less liquid and there is
very limited trading activity, the investments
are generally classified as Level 3. The
use of independent non-binding broker
quotations to value investments generally
indicates there is a lack of liquidity or a lack
of transparency in the process to develop the
valuation estimates, generally causing these
investments to be classified in Level 3.

During the years ended December 31, 2013
and 2012, there were no transfers between
levels.

Equity investments
These investments are principally valued
using the market approach. Valuations are
based primarily on quoted prices in active
markets that are readily and regularly
obtainable and are classified in Level 1.
Certain of these securities including privately
held securities, are valued based on the
market approach matrix pricing and the
inputs include quoted prices for identical
securities that are less liquid and based on
lower levels of trading activity than securities
classified in Level 2 and independent nonbinding broker quotations.
