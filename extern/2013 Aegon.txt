world’s leading financial services organizations, providing life

create value
Aegon provides financial services, mainly life insurance
and pensions. We also manage financial assets. Many of
our products last a lifetime. How do we make sure, when
the times comes, that we can pay the pensions, benefits
and claims our customers are expecting... and still make
a profit to share with our investors?

Our five key trends
What will affect our industry in
the coming years? What factors
will influence the way people
buy life insurance or pensions?
What impact will new technology
have? What are the opportunities
and risks for us as a company?
We’ve identified five key trends

And, in the table opposite, we’ve
outlined some of the measures
we’re taking to address a changing
business environment.

Global aging

The world is getting older – By the middle
of this century, nearly 1.5 billion people
worldwide will be over the age of 65.
Governments in many countries can no longer
afford generous state pensions.

Economic recovery is still uncertain – The
world economy is improving, though growth
in many parts of Europe is still sluggish.
Financial markets have risen sharply, but they
remain volatile. Interest rates are still at
historic lows.

Where do we see opportunity and risk?

Where do we see opportunity and risk?

People have to take greater personal
responsibility for saving for retirement.
That means increasing demand for the kinds
of products Aegon offers. At the same time,
as our customer base ages, we will have
to pay out more in pension benefits.

Economic growth is good news for Aegon.
In emerging markets, growth in recent years
has brought an expanding middle class and
an increase in demand for financial products.
Volatile financial markets, however, can
mean additional risk, while low interest rates
may restrict profits.

What are we doing about it?

What are we doing about it?

We’ve improved our overall product mix to
make sure we’re providing the products and
services our customers need. We’ve also
reviewed many of our products, made them
simpler and easier to understand. Meanwhile,
we’ve used longevity swaps in the
Netherlands to reduce risks associated
with longer life expectancy rates.

We’ve continued to strengthen our capital
position, and maintained a “capital buffer”
to guard against sharp swings in financial
markets. We’ve also reduced risk – by scaling
back the sale of some products, hedging our
exposure and placing greater emphasis on
fees, rather than interest rate spreads. In
addition, we’ve maintained a strict pricing
policy, favoring value over volume. We’ve
expanded our presence in some emerging
markets, and continued to cut costs,
where possible.

Rise in new
technologies

Responsible corporate
behavior

The way our products are bought and sold
is changing – Last year, new regulations
effectively ended commissions for brokers
in the Netherlands and the UK.

Technology has brought a change in
customer behavior – Customers are more
willing to go online to research – and buy –
financial products. There’s more visibility
than ever before in terms of pricing and
customer service.

Companies are increasingly expected to
“do the right thing” – More than ever
before, companies need to demonstrate
responsible behavior with regard to their
employment practices, their investments,
the taxes they pay and the goods and
services they buy.

Where do we see opportunity and risk?

Where do we see opportunity and risk?

Where do we see opportunity and risk?

New regulations mean we have an opportunity
to forge a much closer relationship directly
with our customers. But, to do so, we also
need the right products and the right level
of customer service.

Technology is bringing increased competition,
particularly from online-only providers.
But it’s also giving companies like Aegon
an opportunity to expand distribution by
adding online to other existing channels.

Pressure is coming, not only from nongovernmental organizations and the media,
but also from companies, customers and
employees. Increased scrutiny brings
potential risk, of course – but it also brings
benefits for companies willing to adopt
a responsible approach to business.
Increasingly, employees want to work
for companies that share their values.

What are we doing about it?

What are we doing about it?

What are we doing about it?

We’re investing in new distribution, including
online. We’re also expanding direct sales to
customers, and have taken steps to
strengthen customer service. We’ve also
strengthened our Pricing & Product
Development Policy to ensure we continue
to put the interests of our customers at the
heart of our products and services.

We’ve expanded our online business; we’ve
also invested in social media. At the start
of this year, we set up a corporate venture
fund in the US to invest in new financial
technology start-ups. At the same time,
we’ve strengthened other forms of
distribution – through banks, for example;
we’re also looking at new partnerships with
stores and online retailers.

Internally, we’ve brought in employee
volunteering programs; we’ve strengthened
our approach to diversity, health & safety
and talent management. We’ve made
improvements to employee engage­ment.
On the business side, we’ve introduced
social and environmental standards
for our investments, and to help us choose
suppliers. We’re also investing significant
amounts in areas like renewable energy
and affordable housing.

Where do our profits come from?

We have three main sources of revenue: fees and commissions, income from the

investments we make and, by far the most important, the premiums paid in by our

policyholders. In addition, we have income from financial transactions, which can
vary from year to year depending on market conditions.

Alongside our income, we also have costs. These include the claims and benefits we pay
our customers, which account for around three-quarters of the total. We also have our

intermediaries sell our products. We also sometimes take impairments when we believe

Before we get to our net earnings, we have to take into account two other main factors:

investments, these fair value items may represent a very significant amount.

Equally, we pay corporate income tax on our earnings. Our annual profit & loss
statement includes our estimate of the amount of tax relating to that year. This is
distinct from the amount we pay, which may include not only tax on that year’s earnings,
but also payments from other years. In addition, some tax items are not recognized in
the company’s profit & loss statement, but directly in equity.

How did we do in 2013?
Alongside our strategy, we’ve also set
ourselves a series of financial targets
for 2015. These targets will help
ensure our businesses are managed
both for profitability and for the
returns they offer over the longer term.
By the end of last year, we were on
track with two of our targets; further
progress is needed, however, on
earnings and return on equity.

How does a company like Aegon make decisions? How does
it decide, for example, where to invest, where to open a new
business or how much risk to take on?

Area of activity

Policies, statements & guidelines

Corporate
governance

Our approach to Corporate Governance is set out in full
in our Annual Report and corporate governance statement.
We also have articles of association and charters for our
Supervisory, Executive and Management Boards. In
addition, we have internal “approval requirements” setting
out which decisions must be taken by the Executive Board,
when, and under what circumstances2.

Workplace

Pay and
remuneration

All Aegon employees are bound by our Code of Conduct,
which covers areas such as anti-corruption, data privacy
and behavior in the workplace. Alongside the Code of
Conduct, we also have a Statement on Diversity & NonDiscrimination, insider trading rules for employees,
rules for charitable donations and a Health & Safety
Statement, setting out minimum standards across the
organization. In addition, there is a Financial Crime
Notification & Reporting Procedure, which deals with
fraud, bribery and other forms of corruption. Our company
environmental policy stresses the importance of reducing
consumption of energy and other raw materials, such as
paper and water.
We have a Global Remuneration Framework, based on
the principle of “pay for performance”. The Framework
sets down principles for both fixed and variable pay. We
also have specific remuneration policies for members of
both our Executive and Supervisory Boards.

Policy, setting out guidelines for how we behave as
a shareholder in other companies.

Aegon is also one of the founding signatories of the UNEP-FI’s Principles for Sustainable
Insurance (PSI). The aim of the PSI is to make sure sustainability becomes “business as usual”.
The PSI comprises four basic principles. Against each of these principles, we’ve set ourselves
specific goals and targets. Each year we report our progress:

1

We will embed in our decision-making environmental, social and governance issues, relevant to our insurance business.

Goals and targets
What will we do to put this principle into practice?

Progress
What have we done so far?

Implement minimum standards of market conduct – both for
ourselves and our brokers and intermediaries.

We’ve adopted a set of six basic market conduct principles. These principles apply to all our
businesses worldwide, and ensure we put the interests of our customers first.

Introduce new rules for pricing our products focused, in part,
on benefits for customers.

We’ve introduced a new pricing and product development policy. This commits us to calculating
potential benefits to customers before approving any new product or service.

Where possible, make our products clearer and easier for our
customers to understand.

We’ve re-written hundreds of customer letters and other correspondence to make them easier
to read. We’ve also launched products that can be applied for or bought online.

Use our employees’ diversity to bring new insights into our
business.

We’ve set out our commitments in this area with a new company-wide Statement on Diversity &
Non-Discrimination. We’re also promoting greater diversity in our businesses through discussion
groups, training and other local events.

Develop a set of indicators and measurements to track progress
on our overall sustainability strategy

We’ve put in place key performance indicators for each of our four “strategic objectives”.
We’ll continue to report progress against these KPIs in the years ahead.

2

We will work together with our clients and business partners to raise awareness of environmental, social and governance issue,
manage risk and develop solutions.

Goals and targets
What will we do to put this principle into practice?

Progress
What have we done so far?

Put in place minimum social and environmental standards for the
goods and services we buy.

We've introduced a new Sustainable Procurement Policy. This policy applies to all our
businesses worldwide, and is based on regular ESG risk assesments.

Make sure we invest responsibly and engage actively with
companies we invest in.

We have a Responsible Investment Policy, covering all major asset classes. As part of this
policy, we engage regularly with the companies we invest in on social and environmental
issues and on issues of corporate governance.

Look at opportunities to expand investments where there are clear
social or environmental benefits.

Currently, we have just under €3 billion in “impact investments”. These investments include
affordable housing, renewable energy and sustainable timber. Over the past year, we’ve also
invested in new green bonds issued by the European Investment Bank.

3

We will work together with governments, regulators and other key stakeholders to promote widespread action across society
on environmental, social and governance issues.

Goals and targets
What will we do to put this principle into practice?

Progress
What have we done so far?

Organize panels of stakeholders to provide feedback on our work
and performance.

We have a stakeholder panel in the Netherlands, which meets at least twice a year.
Plans to organize similar panels in the UK and US have been delayed, however.

Fund research into aging and demographic change in both Europe
and the US.

We have a dedicated non-profit research center in the US, and publish regular Retirement
Readiness surveys based on research in the US, Europe and Asia. We’ve also agreed a separate
research partnership with AgeLab, part of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

Provide limited paid time-off to allow employees to support
community projects and initiatives.

At the end of 2013, more than 90% of our employees could claim paid time-off for volunteer

1 Last year, we changed our methodology with regard to this information. Figures for engagement in 2013 refer to the number of individual companies engaged during the year,
whereas figures for 2012 refer to the number of separate engagements. In 2013, the number of engagements totaled 326.
2 Negative figures denote amounts received from the tax authorities. Please note that there is often no direct correlation between tax on earnings for any given year and amounts
paid or received in tax. Part of the explanation for this is that certain tax deductible items are not recognized in the company’s profit & loss statement, but directly in equity.
Amounts may also include payments from other years.
