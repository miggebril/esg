Demographic Change

Global issues

From Changing Populations to Old Age Provision
Demographic change is creating both opportunities and
challenges for financial services providers. While the
urban populations of Asia and Africa are expanding
and their middle classes growing, western nations’
populations are aging and their workforces are shrinking.
With more over-60s than ever before1, and declining birth
rates, social security systems in the West are under
pressure and the need for additional pension provision is
increasing. In developing countries, the need for formal
social security systems is growing due to the weakening
of traditional family ties. We are responding to these
trends with integrated asset management and insurance
solutions. And since the profile of our workforce is
changing as well, we use dynamic forecasts from
our Strategic Workforce Planning to support Human
Resources decision-making.

Join us on our
A–Z Sustainability Journey
As a financial services provider operating in over 70 markets, the success
of our business is heavily affected by a variety of global, long-term issues.
To ensure sustainable and profitable growth we place a high priority on
monitoring, analyzing and responding to the challenges and opportunities
these issues present, today and tomorrow. We are working towards a
low-carbon economy, where our customers are well prepared for their
retirement, and where more people are financially literate and have
access to financial services. Join us on our sustainability journey.

Climate Change

From Alternative Energy to Zero Emissions
Climate change poses a major risk to the global economy
and, for a global financial services company like Allianz,
climate change could have a severe impact on our
business. As a result, we have been implementing a
Group-wide strategy covering climate-related risks and
opportunities, both for our business and our customers.
We finance and insure low-carbon energy projects,
such as wind farms and solar parks; offer customers
green products and services such as providing advice
on weather-related risk reduction; as well as incorporate
sustainability factors into our third-party asset
management fund range; and reduce and offset
our own carbon emissions.

Access to Finance

From Financial Literacy to Microinsurance
With a third of the world’s population living on between
1.25 and 4 U.S. Dollars a day2, we focus on providing
low-income people with access to finance. From life
and health to crop insurance, our growing microinsurance
portfolio is helping more than 24 million people in
developing countries to protect themselves against and
better manage the risks in life to build a more secure
future. And since financial inclusion is not simply a matter
of providing access to banking services or insurance
schemes, we are committed to supporting improved
financial literacy through financial education
in all age groups in the markets we serve.

04 OUR A–Z SUSTAINABILITY JOURNEY

Statement by Maximilian Zimmerer

Investing in
climate
protection

Climate change is a fact. It is also fairly certain that it
is accelerated by human activity and that we will
have to adapt to its consequences in the long term.
The debt crisis has pushed climate change to the sidelines
of the political and public agenda over the past few years.
Yet time is running out and it is precisely now that
we would be well advised to launch solutions for a
low-carbon future. In both industrialized countries
and emerging markets, these solutions include the
establishment and expansion of a modern infrastructure
and a stable supply of renewable energy. At a time
of scarce public funds, the necessary expansion of
infrastructure, particularly that of the electricity grid,
is only possible with private investment.
Germany has already achieved a great deal
Take Germany, for example. The country has assumed
a leading position in climate protection and has already
achieved a great deal. The energy transition has begun
and is irreversible. The share of renewable energy in
electricity production has doubled to over 20% since 2006
– a development no one would have dared to predict ten
years ago. However, it is disappointing that CO2 emissions
from electricity generation have increased over the past
two years. The reason is that we are using considerably
more coal than previously, because it continues to be
a cheaper means of generating electricity than gas.
The price of CO2 certificates in EU emissions trading
has dropped. Conversely, the inefficiency of the grid
expansion and slow expansion of storage technologies to
date have led to an unnecessary rise in electricity prices.

“Pension investments finance
infrastructure, and infrastructure
yields finance retirement.”
MAXIMILIAN ZIMMERER
MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF
MANAGEMENT, ALLIANZ SE

To keep the costs low for consumers, a change of the
support system is required. One idea would be to
stipulate what proportion of electricity providers’
electricity mix must be from renewable energy. The
providers would then have to ensure they used the most
cost-efficient method of production. From an economic
perspective, this would be a healthier method than the
current broad-based, unfocused approach to subsidies.

Need for reforms
The political sphere also needs to relinquish responsibility;
it must open itself up to partnerships. Governments can
continue to set the requirements, but private investors
are bearing the costs and project risks and should
therefore be responsible for the planning. In many cases,
however, the political sphere is not yet ready to delegate
tasks and relinquish responsibility. In other countries, this
practice has been established for many years, and private
investors often kick-start public investments. A clear
procurement process makes it easier for investors and,
logically, increases reliability.
There is also currently a need for reform at a European
level. This is related to ‘unbundling’, or more specifically,
the EU directive on separate ownership of electricity
production and networks. What was once intended
to combat the monopolizing tendencies of electricity
producers is now also hindering investors. Anyone
investing in wind power plants must also be able to
arrange for the electricity to be transported or stored.
Linking climate change to demographic change
Both in Germany and in other countries, the advantages
of partnerships between the public sector and investors
like Allianz are obvious. The costs of our aging society are
likely to add to the high debt levels of countries in the
foreseeable future, and both will result in a further drop
in public investment. One solution is to link the challenges
of demographic change with urgent infrastructure
investment. In short, pension investments finance
infrastructure, and infrastructure yields finance
retirement. It seems likely that the need for long-term
opportunities to invest retirement provisions profitably is
rising as the percentage of older people in the population
increases. At the same time, the capital requirement
for the energy turnaround is high and also long term.
If the two are linked, the climate and societies could
benefit to an equal extent.
And there is also another reason for joining forces:
experience. We at Allianz also had to initially acquire the
necessary expertise. We now have teams of experts for
infrastructure investments. A team of a dozen specialists
based in London deals with wind and solar investments.
So far our focus has been on the euro zone, especially
because of currency risks. In future, however, we want to
diversify more internationally. We plan to invest around
400 million Euros in renewable energy every year. The
total investment reached over 1.7 billion Euros in 2013.

“The Allianz Group is carbon-neutral.
Of course, it is easier for us to achieve
this than it is for a steel company
but, from another perspective, our
opportunities for carbon reduction
are more limited, because as a
service provider we have less
leverage potential.”
Taking innovative approaches
We have already achieved the climate protection
objectives that we set ourselves. The Allianz Group is
carbon-neutral. Of course, it is easier for us to achieve
this than it is for a steel company but, from another
perspective, our opportunities for carbon reduction are
more limited, because as a service provider we have less
leverage potential. We are therefore especially pleased
to have reduced our emissions from business travel
as well as our paper and electricity use by more than
37.2% since 2006. We offset our remaining carbon
emissions with the help of carbon certificates, which
we obtain by investing in forest and climate protection
projects in Kenya, India and Indonesia.
Allianz also provides its customers with the opportunity
to participate actively in climate protection. We offer
over 150 green solutions, but the green label alone
is not enough. Simply insuring electric cars is not a
green service; it is only the special tariff that adds the
environmental aspect. Customers expect to benefit on
the price and service level because they are buying an
environmentally-friendly product with special insurance
cover. However, for many insurance products, this
connection is more complicated and harder to
communicate to the client. For example, a life insurance
client will not necessarily appreciate that the return
for their savings contract might fall by 0.2 percentage
points simply because the insurer is investing in
renewable energy. This means that even if we take
innovative, climate-protecting approaches, we remain
committed to our three traditional investment principles:
return, security and diversification.

We are focusing our carbon reduction efforts in the areas
of energy consumption, business travel and paper use.
We tackle these three areas through a strategic approach
and by our established Group-wide standards, including
a green IT hardware purchasing policy, a global travel
regulation and a global print policy.
The green IT policy ensures that we purchase energyefficient devices. An additional focus in recent years has
been consolidating our server infrastructure to deliver
energy-efficiency gains. We also audit the energy
performance of Allianz buildings to determine their
energy-efficiency and potential for carbon reductions.
Our global travel regulation sets minimum standards
for employee business travel to help reduce unnecessary
travel and promote lower-carbon modes of transport.

We promote videoconferencing and rail travel
as alternatives to air travel in order to reduce
emissions, cut costs and improve the work-life
balance of our employees.
Our global print policy cuts overall paper consumption
and reduces costs, in part by stipulating double-sided
printing as the default. About one quarter of the paper
we are using is from recycled sources.
Finally, we offset our remaining emissions through
direct investment in carbon projects, including
energy efficiency and REDD (Reducing Emissions
from Deforestation and forest Degradation) projects
(see page 14).

I am responsible for environmental issues at Allianz
France. It’s a very enjoyable job because I get to work

for lots of different items.

Allianz entity: Allianz Seguros, Spain
I have worked in the purchasing unit of our Operations
Division since mid-2011 and I became a Local
Environmental Officer in December 2011. Within the
Operations Division I am also responsible for analyzing
client demands, improving working processes and
following key performance indicators.

What we are doing to improve our footprint
A major source of CO2 in Allianz France is business travel.
We have a car fleet of 4,378 vehicles, which are mainly for
sales activity and visiting customers. For many years we
have chosen car models with lower CO2 emissions and our
fleet now includes 197 hybrid cars and one fully electric
van. The average CO2 emissions from the vehicles in our
fleet is 107 g/km. The challenge we face is the difficulty in
reducing kilometers travelled because face-to-face
meetings are essential for core business. So we are working
to set up eco-driver training and to install on-board
telematics equipment to monitor fuel consumption.

What we are doing to improve our footprint
We began our paperless initiative in 2012 to support
our Group Digital Initiative and to tackle CO2 emissions.
Through this initiative we aim to reduce CO2 emissions
from paper use, improve communication with customers,
and reduce costs. In 2013 we sent out almost 60,000
insurance policies by email, saving more than half a
million sheets of paper. Including other types of
documentation, in total in 2013 we avoided using
3.5 million sheets of paper and 400,000 envelopes, saving
the equivalent of 215 trees. For 2014, we are aiming for
paper savings equivalent to a further 350 trees.

What we are doing to improve our footprint
By installing six fuel cells on our Novato campus in
California, Fireman’s Fund has taken a major step in
reducing its carbon footprint. These high-tech devices
convert fuel into electricity though a clean electrochemical process and allow us to generate 66% of the
campus’ energy needs. Together they have reduced the
carbon footprint of Novato campus by 37% and have
contributed to an overall 15% carbon reduction across
the whole Fireman’s Fund real estate portfolio. In addition,
the fuel cells have also reduced our annual electricity
bill by over 300,000 U.S. Dollars.

“These fuel cells are a further
demonstration of our commitment
to walking the talk when it comes
to reducing our carbon footprint.
What we are doing is not just good
for the environment and for future
generations, it makes economic
sense today.”

“There is a real commitment within
Allianz France, and from its top
management, to support substantial
changes that will help to reduce
our carbon footprint.”

“The paperless initiative requires
collaboration from many
departments including marketing,
IT and our operations division.
This can be a challenge but
it helps that top management
strongly believe in it.”

Investing in
renewable energy

Allianz’s commitment to the European renewable
energy sector now exceeds 1.7 billion Euros
across some 40 wind farms and seven solar
parks located in France, Germany, Italy, and
most recently, Sweden. Together, these assets
generate sufficient renewable energy to supply
over 500,000 households.

From Solar parks near Rome
to Wind farms powering Google
As large institutional investors, insurance
companies like Allianz are important players
in financing the journey to a low-carbon
economy. Climate-related investments such
as renewable energy and power infrastructure
are attractive investments, providing portfolio
diversification which spreads risk, and stable
long-term returns. Because of these benefits,
we are one of the world’s largest investors in
renewable energy projects, helping provide
the investment needed to move

to manage a large renewables portfolio,
they offer their expertise to other investors
and banks, and they identify technological
risks to help protect manufacturers,
operators and investors from financial
losses. Here, three of our experts explain
what you need to know about the
‘Energiewende’ – the transition to
renewable energy. Asked about the
challenges in the coming years, their
answers are surprisingly similar: the
cost of technology needs to be lower,
infrastructure needs to be adjusted,
and regulation needs to evolve to
minimize risks and incentivize change.

David Jones
Head of Renewable Energy

Henriette Schweizerhof
Analyst

Andreas Bemm
Senior Engineer and Risk Consultant

From your perspective, what will it take
to successfully achieve the transition to
renewable energy on a global scale?
It will take many decades and will require both
technological and regulatory advances. The technologies
that produce renewable energy must become
significantly cheaper to narrow the price gap with
hydrocarbon-based power so that it becomes more
affordable. The challenge of intermittent supply with
renewable energy must also be addressed with
substantially reinforced grid networks and, eventually,
economic storage solutions. Regulation needs to evolve
as the transition progresses to ensure that sufficient
incentives exist to maintain the momentum of change.
At the same time, to keep the lights on we need to
ensure flexible back-up generating capacity remains
viable. Balancing these goals while ensuring that
electricity remains affordable will be the main regulatory
challenge until renewables become the lowest cost
option and the transition is complete.

From your perspective, what will it take
to successfully achieve the transition to
renewable energy on a global scale?
In my opinion, the global energy transition will only
succeed if it generates economic benefits and achieves
climate objectives at the same time. Policymakers
have to guarantee there will be a competitive and fair
environment for renewable energy. In order to make
renewables the most competitive source of energy,
the costs associated with the technology need to
be lowered and the risks minimized. The energy
infrastructure also has to be adjusted. Crucial aspects
in this context are storage, grid expansion and flexibility
on the demand side.

From your perspective, what will it take
to successfully achieve the transition to
renewable energy on a global scale?
The energy transition represents a paradigm shift in the
structure of energy supply. This means our centralized
supply system needs to be decentralized and split up into
lots of small and medium-sized power generating plants.
To guarantee the stability of this supply, we not only
need new storage technologies but also an overarching
information and communication technology structure
to gather performance data of energy suppliers and
users. Smart grids and smart metering are a couple of
the key words used here. Any solutions considered must
guarantee availability, uninterrupted service, information
and data security, cut CO2 emissions, create a positive
energy footprint and be cost-effective. Failure to satisfy
any one of these aspects could doom the energy
transition to fail.

How are you contributing to the transition
in your daily work?
I contribute by directly investing in renewable energy
assets for Allianz Capital Partners. Currently, our
renewables portfolio comprises some 40 wind and
seven solar farms in France, Germany, Italy and Sweden.
Together, the facilities represent more than 1,000
Megawatts of capacity and can generate enough
electricity for a city the size of Brussels, making Allianz
one of the world’s largest financial investors in renewable
energy. With operating lives of 20 years or more,
these assets fit perfectly with our long-term investment
horizons. Life insurance policies that are signed today
usually don't come due for many years or even decades,
and so to fulfill these obligations insurers like Allianz need
stable investments and long-term yields. This is exactly
what wind and solar farms have to offer. Right now
we're looking at returns of between 6 and 8% – much
higher than many other asset classes – and they’re
totally uncorrelated with the ups and downs of the
financial markets.

How are you contributing to this transition
in your daily work?
Here in the Risk Advisory & Services at Allianz Climate
Solutions, we have a comprehensive understanding of
the risks associated with renewable energy projects.
One of our key areas of consulting expertise is quality
assurance for project financing. We help investors and
banks to identify whether a wind or solar project will be
able to yield the desired returns. A project can only be
classed as successful if the individual technical
components used are of high quality, the relevant norms
have been met, and the guarantees conform to the
standard market conditions. When it comes to financing,
we make sure that the money loaned to the project can
be paid back, even if (using a wind project as an example)
the wind does not blow strongly for prolonged periods of
time. Our contribution to the energy transition is that we
apply our expertise to ensure that more high-quality
projects can be implemented. These projects ultimately
bring about the economic benefits necessary for the
global energy transition to be successful.

How are you contributing to this transition
in your daily work?
At the Allianz Risk Consulting/Allianz Center for
Technology, our core tasks are loss analysis and risk
consulting with the aim of helping to reduce technical
risks. We look at proven technologies as well as new
technologies. Among these new technologies are
renewable energy – such as wind power, photovoltaic
panels, solar-thermal energy, biomass and storage
technologies. Our goal is to identify threats and minimize
risks – with a view to protecting manufacturers, operators
and investors of these plants from financial losses.
Our expertise is the product of our day-to-day experience
of analyzing the causes of loss. We exchange insights
with other experts in specialist committees and
cooperate with partners from industry, universities
and research institutes.

INVESTING TO BENEFIT LOCAL COMMUNITIES
Back in 2011, we became involved in a forest protection
project in the Kasigau Corridor in Kenya – the first project
in the world to be given REDD (Reducing Emissions from
Deforestation and Degradation) status. The 200,000
hectares of forest protected is home to endangered
cheetahs, lions, and over 2,000 African elephants.
The project will generate an average of 1.2 million
tons of carbon certificates per year over the 30-year
life of the project.

Investing in
forest protection
Carbon projects make it possible to finance
climate protection, help us offset our
emissions and benefit local communities.
For climate protection, the value of a forest lies in its
capacity to store carbon. Forest protection is therefore
an important part of tackling climate change. By placing a
financial value on undisturbed forests, a market incentive
for their protection can be created. This is what REDD
(Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest
Degradation) projects achieve. Through forest protection
they generate tradable carbon certificates which have a
value in carbon markets. REDD‘+’ projects also involve
local communities and ensure that the income generated
by a project is invested locally.

€
For a full picture, see our
REDD+ infographic at
www.allianz.com/
sustainability/redd

“The concept of REDD is: You let a tree stand
and you are paid for that, you plant more
trees and you get more money. At first the
people thought this is madness, how can
someone pay for a tree that he has not seen
grow? But then that concept has really
inspired the people. REDD+ brings a positive
change to our region with real and direct
solutions for poverty alleviation that will uplift
our community. This is not charity. Carbon
money helps us meet basic needs and
improve our lifestyle. The money is earned
through conservation activities that afford
us the ability to protect our environment.”
CHIEF PASCAL KIZAKA
CHIEF OF KASIGAU DISTRICT,
COAST PROVINCE OF KENYA

“Women are supported by the REDD+
project, and this is particularly important
as women are the ambassadors of change.
When you train a woman you have trained
the whole community. We are focusing
on literacy, water, education, job creation,
and sustainability. Now that there are
jobs, there is hope for a better future.”
MAMA MERCY NGARUIYA
CHAIR OF THE TUMAINI WOMEN’S GROUP,
KASIGAU DISTRICT, COAST PROVINCE OF KENYA

In 2013, we made a further investment in ‘Rimba Raya’
(translated ‘infinite forest’) in southern Borneo,
Indonesia. This investment will protect 64,000 hectares
of rainforest (an areas twice the size of Munich) from
deforestation and also provide a shelter zone for an
established orangutan orphanage.
Our investments provide us with carbon certificates
that we use to offset our own emissions, enabling us
to be a carbon-neutral company.
But since REDD+ is not only about carbon offsetting,
forest and wildlife protection, we work closely with
local partners to involve the communities. Some of the
revenue generated by the carbon certificates from the
REDD+ projects is earmarked for initiatives to improve,
for example, water treatment, healthcare, education,
and establish ecotourism. In the Kasigau Corridor, for
example, more than 100,000 people in surrounding
communities benefit directly from carbon financing
through projects coordinated by our partner organization
Wildlife Works.

By the middle of the century, there could be almost

Half of the world’s population already lives in cities, and
every year 60 million more join them. By the middle of
the century, there could be as many people living in
cities as are alive today.4
Cities are a great source of dynamism and wealth. The
world’s top 600 cities alone generate over half of global
GDP. The future of our economies will increasingly rely
on what happens in metropolitan areas, in particular
in China, India, Brazil and other emerging countries.
Urbanization has a profound impact on the world’s
climate. Already, cities produce around 70% of global
emissions5, and this share will grow as more people live,
work, and move around in cities. The dilemma is how
to support the wealth-creating effects of urbanization
without damaging the world’s climate.
Cities can no longer wait for a global climate agreement.
They need to act now. Most large cities already have their
own environmental targets. But most fall woefully short
of them.
If cities are to become leaders in the fight against climate
change, the prime focus must be on infrastructure. The
vast majority of harmful emissions come from power
stations, cars and buildings – or more specifically the
energy that is used in them. Enormous investments are
required to shift urban power generation from coal and
oil to renewable and other low-carbon sources of energy;
to encourage people to use public transport or electric
cars; and to renovate buildings to make them more
efficient. Based on various studies, we estimate that
global investment of 2 trillion U.S. Dollars will be needed
for the next 20 years to upgrade urban infrastructure and
make it climate neutral.
Governments do not have this kind of money, particularly
at a time when many are forced to cut their budgets.
Banks, which have traditionally provided long-term loans
to developers of power stations or roads, are constrained
by weak balance sheets and new regulations. Insurers,
pension funds and other institutional investors should,
in theory, be interested in financing sustainable urban
infrastructure. Institutional investors have some 70 trillion
U.S. Dollars under management6 and are looking to
diversify out of low-yielding bonds and volatile equities
in favor of long-term investments that match the decadelong obligations they have to their clients.

Insurance companies and pension funds are moving into
the area of sustainable infrastructure, but only slowly.
Although infrastructure investments are often complex
and their risks are hard to assess, many investors would
like to get more engaged if the political and market
conditions were right. We therefore hope to support a
dialogue between policymakers, experts and investors on
what can be done to bridge the urban investment gap.
In many countries, policies need to change to encourage
private long-term investment. New financial market
regulations sometimes penalize banks and institutional
investors for financing infrastructure. This needs to be
looked at. Also, there is simply no easily accessible market
for infrastructure: Most institutional investors do not have
the resources to search for suitable investment
opportunities on the one hand, and on the other, many
city officials have very little experience in working with
private investors. Therefore, we encourage governments
and investors to work together to establish a green-citiesplatform, where sustainable urban infrastructure projects
can be aggregated, assessed and then sold to institutional
investors. Such a platform could be a crucial first step
towards addressing one of society’s dilemmas of the
21st century.

“Without massive investment to make
cities greener, the battle against
climate change will be lost. Insurers,
pension funds and other institutional
investors can help to bridge the
investment gap, especially at a time
when banks and governments are
constrained.”

Great opportunities
The widespread hope to put a stop to climate change by
means of global agreements has yielded few tangible
results so far. So how do we move forward if we don’t
manage to conclude agreements to reduce carbon
emissions and to slow down climate change? There are
few options. We need to get used to this new extreme
situation. Every one of us, as individuals, needs to review
our lifestyle and consumption habits, and together we
need to take pragmatic precautions against climate
impacts at a local level.
In our role as an insurer, we are supporting this process
by gradually shaking-up our insurance and investment
portfolio, so that customers have the option of purchasing
a green alternative. We are drawing on many years of
experience as an insurer and risk manager to develop
financial products that enable us to take an active role
in climate protection.
Green Solutions not only offer a great opportunity to
broaden our product offering, they help consumers to
manage arising risks and seize new opportunities while
at the same time contribute to environmental solutions.
Sometimes this will mean a differentiation in prices. For
example, taking an ecological approach to repairing a
damaged building is generally more expensive than using
traditional building materials and technologies. But while
making a building green may be expensive, green
buildings tend to experience fewer incidents of loss. So
‘green’ alternatives can also be more expensive and less
expensive at the same time. Solutions that incentivize our
customers to behave in an environmentally-friendly way
often reduce risks and therefore allow
for a lower premium. As another
example, car insurance policies
can incentivize customers to
drive less if this is reflected
in their pricing. Over the past
few years, while working
with Green Solutions,
we have learned that they
reduce our short-term risks
while contributing to
long-term emissions reduction.

The practical side
As the scale of wind and solar parks grows, the risks
associated with them do too. Allianz was one of the first
global insurers to react to these challenges with tailormade insurance products for the renewable energy sector.
For offshore wind farm projects, for example, Allianz
Global Corporate & Specialty (AGCS) insures every phase,
from turbine production to operation. Offshore wind has
a 40% higher energy output than onshore wind. What
it also has, however, are more challenging conditions.
Strong, gusty winds, waves and very salty water can
all cause significant wear and tear on the equipment.
Before AGCS provides insurance coverage to large-scale
renewable energy projects, a team of six engineering
specialists closely examines the technology being
employed. We do not just want to evaluate the risks from
the confines of our own offices. We prefer to take a look
at them directly for ourselves as the practical side always
looks different from the theoretical side. I have already
completed specialist engineering training – from a
helicopter hoist course to survival training.
It is unusual for insurers to acquire these skills,
but necessary if Allianz intends to
work successfully and profitably
in this growing area.

CASE STUDY

Sahel crop insurance, Burkina Faso and Mali
One way to address food crises is to improve
smallholder farmers’ resilience to the risks
associated with weather extremes that can
lead to crop failure.
We have been providing crop microinsurance to farmers
since 2011 through two pilot projects in Burkina Faso and
Mali. In the event of serious crop failure, the insurance
covers the loans farmers take out each year to buy seeds
for the growing season. In essence, it is a rain deficit
insurance, whereby satellite imaging technology
is used to monitor crop growth in insured areas.
When evapotranspiration rates fall below the level
that indicates crop failure, insured farmers receive an
automatic payment to cover their seed loans.

As with most microinsurance products, customer
education is essential to generate an understanding
of the concept and benefits of insurance. Therefore,
employees of Planet Guarantee, which is our main
partner for microinsurance in Africa, engage in
educating the farmers to better manage their risks.
In broad terms, the insurance allows smallholder farmers
to take greater risks, leading to higher revenues in the
long run. It helps to strengthen local food supplies,
reducing dependency on aid delivery that can
weaken the production efforts of local farmers.

Initially the response to the insurance was muted with
only 361 farmers taking out the insurance in 2011.
Following a severe drought during the growing season,
which triggered a payout for crop failure, the response
has picked up dramatically. In 2013, over 15,000 farmers
in Burkina Faso and Mali took out crop failure policies
with Allianz Africa.
SEED LOAN AND INSURANCE PAYOUT IF CROP FAILS

“I was reluctant at first, but now I appreciate
crop insurance. When the rains failed I was really
surprised when the insurance company came the
long way to my village to bring me the news that
I receive an insurance payment for my seed loan.
I wish that the crop insurance will become a
great success because it is a good product
for us, the farmers.”

?

What data is available
for our risk models

Finding answers to these questions is daily work for the teams of financial specialists
and natural scientists at Allianz. With climate change the questions themselves are
not changing, however finding answers is becoming more urgent.
NATURAL CATASTROPHE RISK ON THE RISE
Over the past 40 years, climate and weather-related
insurance claims have increased dramatically. Average
insured claims per year have risen from less than
15 billion U.S. Dollars during the 1980s, to around
70 billion U.S. Dollars per year over the last three years.7
IS CLIMATE CHANGE TO BLAME?
Our opinion is that climate change will have a
considerable impact over the long-term and lead to
major shifts in risk landscapes worldwide. Most studies
suggest that climate change will cause more frequent
and severe weather events especially when it comes to
heatwaves, windstorms and heavy precipitation in the
future. In turn, these changes are increasing the
frequency and severity of phenomena such as droughts,
wildfires and floods. Climate change also causes longterm changes to our environment, such as desertification,
ocean warming and rising sea levels.

BEYOND CLIMATE CHANGE
However, currently the main factor behind increasing
insured losses is very simply economic growth. More
and more people are moving to high-risk areas which is
concentrating values insured. It is difficult to separate the
purely physical factors – such as increasing rainfall – from
the socio-economic factors. For example, settlement in
coastal areas and other regions at risk of flooding is still
on the increase. Many of the world's million-strong cities
are not sufficiently equipped to cope with storms, as
the impact of hurricane Sandy on New York in 2012
has shown. The United States is at risk of even worse
devastation from natural disasters resulting from
climate change-linked sea level rise in combination
with increased urbanization.8

CALCULATING THE UNFORESEEABLE
As an insurer we need to continually improve our
understanding of damages related to natural
catastrophes. In reality, we need to calculate the
unforeseeable. Allianz has mathematicians,
meteorologists and risk analysts working in the fields
of risk management, catastrophe modeling and loss
research. As a result, in the last decade we have
considerably enhanced our risk models and simulations.
In the past, potential losses were simply calculated by
actuaries on the basis of historical loss statistics. Today,
Allianz uses sophisticated computer models. Our task
is to find the right data of the right quality to input
into these models. We have to precisely record local
infrastructure – that is the design, size and age of a
building – and link this information with local weather
and geographic data, as well as with climate forecasts.
Lessons we have learned from the past are key.
Retrospectively, we can see where we recognized trends
too late, overlooked customer needs, or underestimated
interdependencies and exposure developments. For
example, business disruptions after the floods in Thailand
and the earthquake in Japan in 2011 made it clear that
companies and their insurance partners did not have
enough data about the actual risks inherent in global
supply chains. Based on 2013 data, business interruption
and supply chain losses account for around 50-70% of all
insured property losses, up to as much as 26 billion U.S.
Dollars a year. These risks represent the number
one concern for businesses around the globe.9
PARTNERING UP FOR BETTER RISK MANAGEMENT
Not only do we need to understand our own risks but
we also need to help our customers to manage theirs.
As an insurer we provide risk information to our
customers and provide recommendations on how
to reduce these risks (e.g. this is the role of our risk

consultants). We also work together with partners
from academia to understand trends and impacts, and
publish the conclusions in order to trigger constructive
dialogues (e.g. the Climate study of the German
Insurance Association).
PASSING ON THE RISKS
Finally, as an insurer we need to manage our own risk
in order to stay solvent and be able to pay claims during
crisis events. After hurricane Sandy, private insurance
companies received 1.5 million claims accounting for
18.75 billion U.S. Dollars of insured losses.10 At Allianz we
have integrated risk management to take advantage of
our global presence and leverage diversification. As a last
step we also pass part of our risks on to other parties in
order to reduce our own losses. Traditionally we purchase
catastrophe reinsurance and since 2007 we also issue
NatCat bonds, which transfer the risk to investors on the
capital markets.
WORK TO BE DONE
Pricing insurance premiums and NatCat bonds accurately
in the future will depend on the ability of the models
underlying them to reflect the changing reality. When
hurricane Katrina struck in 2005, its unexpected ferocity
caused many modelers to reassess the likelihood of
such an extreme event occurring to be twice as likely as
previously thought, causing turmoil in the market. Even
though in the case of Katrina the man-made component
was the dominant factor in the losses, it is a reminder of
the inherent difficulties involved in predicting extreme
events. Global weather phenomena are incredibly
interdependent, and it would be unwise to assume we
have mastered them fully. There is always work to be
done on the models. With climate change, the world
itself is changing and reacting.

An insurer’s perspective on climate change

Supporting our customers
in catastrophic times
Extreme events like major natural
catastrophes illustrate the value and
importance of insurance to society.
In such events, the most important
thing is to help those affected quickly,
unbureaucratically and with a lot
of empathy.

USA: SAVING THE GUITARS OF NASHVILLE ARTISTS
Nashville, home to America’s music industry and
therefore known as ‘music city’, experienced heavy floods
in May 2010. Fireman’s Fund, an Allianz company,
immediately dispatched a team to the region to assess
the damage. They found that flooding, strong winds,
power outages, and fire from lightning strikes were the
main issues. Apart from personal property claims, there
were claims from the entertainment area with local
musicians who approached the team and asked if Allianz
could help. In response, the team brought in additional
expertise helping the artists save their guitars and
enabling the show to go in Nashville.

USA: REACHING OUT TO CUSTOMERS AFTER SANDY
Hurricane Sandy created havoc along the American east
coast in 2012. Fireman’s Fund tracked the storm and had
claims adjusters on standby to move quickly into affected
areas when the hurricane hit. Customers were kept
informed through text messages, emails and facebook
that the team was deployed and ready to respond, and
how they could make a claim. When disaster struck,
Allianz was on the ground and able to quickly respond.
Reaching customers initially was a challenge due to
widespread power outages, lack of cellphone service and
road closures. However, through persistence,
determination and a dose of creativity we met our
promise of being there for our customers in their time of
need. Claimants were relieved Allianz reached them so
quickly and were reassured by the team’s daily presence
– especially when climbing through rubble, into attics and
onto rooftops was required to obtain a thorough
inspection of damaged properties.

AUSTRALIA: SHIPS IN DISTRESS
Many parts of Queensland were already flooded from extraordinary
amounts of rainfall when the Brisbane river began to swell in January
2011. Before the river burst its banks, experts from Allianz’s subsidiary
Club Marine, Australia’s largest pleasure craft insurer, were down
at the marina helping to bring the boats to safety. Unfortunately,
they couldn’t save them all, but they formed a joint search and rescue
team with the coastguard – and were the only boat insurer to do so.
Together they retrieved 45 of the 50 missing boats.

INDIA: CYCLONE NISHA BRINGS HOME THE VALUE
OF INSURANCE
In 2010, the Indian state of Tamil Nadu was ravaged by
cyclone Nisha. Among the few groups who responded
was a team of five Bajaj-Allianz insurance specialists
who went to the flooded region to help low income
microinsurance holders settle their claims so they could
start to rebuild their lives. With 16,000 claims in 44
villages within a matter of days, the scale of destruction
from Nisha required a pooling of resources with
community and humanitarian partners to speed up
claims settlement. For many local people it made them
realize the value of insurance – they saw others wading
through the water carrying what few possessions had
not been destroyed along with their insurance policy
wrapped in cellophane to prevent it from getting wet.
Interest in microinsurance policies has subsequently
grown in the area.

Tamil Nadu: www.allianz.com/en/sustainability/

THAILAND: CROCODILES AND CORROSION –
ON SITE AFTER THE FLOOD
In 2011, Joachim Hufenreuter, an Allianz expert on
damage to industrial facilities, was sent to Thailand to
inspect factories flooded for six weeks by up to two
meters of water. In the wrecked industrial parks he found
waterlogged walls and mold, rusted machinery, spoiled
food and fire damage. It was the first time in his life that
he was warned about crocodiles. They had escaped from
breeding farms and were roaming the flooded areas.
Luckily he had no such frightening encounter. The floods
impacted more than 14,800 businesses in the northern
and central regions of Thailand, causing disruptions along
global supply chains. The catastrophe cost the insurance
industry an estimated 20 billion U.S. Dollars, which made
the disaster one of the top five most expensive natural
catastrophe events in modern history.11 While Joachim
Hufenreuter’s job is to assess losses, for him the most
important thing is to get businesses up and running again
as soon as possible. Giving customers clarity and security
is what he considers to be his main task.

CZECH REPUBLIC AND SLOVAKIA: TWO COUNTRIES,
TWO COMPANIES, ONE ALLIANZ RESPONSE
The floods that hit the Czech Republic in the summer
of 2013 resulted in an overwhelming number of claims,
mostly from private households and small businesses.
To respond quickly to the 3,000 customers with claims,
Allianz Czech Republic turned to its neighbor, Allianz
Slovakia (formerly part of the same company when
Slovakia and the Czech Republic were the same country)
for assistance. While claimants were surprised to be
greeted in Slovak, they reacted very positively and with
good humor when, for example, the word for roof tile
was lost in translation.

26 OUR A–Z SUSTAINABILITY JOURNEY

An insurer’s perspective on climate change

Flood protection:
Learning from nature
Although we see evidence that climate
change is occurring, it is humanity that is
the key risk factor in many cases. Risk
management should therefore be applied
as part of prevention measures. As we
know, it is often the paths less travelled
that lead to success – for example,
working in partnership with nature.
Markus Aichinger knows what nature is like. As a
meteorologist who works for Allianz, he believes that
torrential rains, summer floods and heatwaves are the
current climatic trend. The record-breaking European
floods in the summer of 2013, for example, were signs
of this ‘New Normal’.
Markus works on Allianz Group’s strategy for cases in
which one single event, like a major flood, leads to a
large number of claims – known in the business as
‘accumulation risk management’. He says: “It is our
challenge to be able to provide insurance within current
trends. Therefore science, insurance, customers and
public institutions need to work together, and learn how
to respond and adapt to freak events of nature.” In some
places, the first lessons have been learned. Flood
prevention and protection are increasingly going handin-hand, and the battle against extreme weather events
can, and should be, a partnership approach – with nature.

Flooding is one of the most common natural disasters in
the world. Asia is particularly badly affected with the risk
of flooding 60 times higher than in the United States. As
an example, in the monsoon season there can be more
rain in one day in New Delhi than in a whole year in New
York12. The development of megacities on rivers and in
coastal zones is a particular cause for concern. In order
to better assess the risks in such cities, the Allianz Cat
Research & Development Team has produced risk models
for India's major cities. These simulations are the first of
their kind in India.
One reason for the high risk of flooding is global
population growth. More and more people are settling in
natural floodplains and, while dams create an illusion of
safety, safety can never be 100% guaranteed. Although
climate change is certainly occurring, it is actually
humanity that is the key risk factor in many cases.
Risk management should be applied as part of flood
prevention: this is where the greatest potential lies.

“We have to learn how to respond
to freak events of nature.”
MARKUS AICHINGER
METEOROLOGIST FOR ALLIANZ SE

On a social level, prevention and protection means not
only implementing warning and emergency measures,
but also taking a responsible approach to town planning.
Sealed surfaces and concreted ground cannot absorb
water. Locating industrial sites on floodplains and in
coastal areas increases the risk of flooding, and dams
alone simply move the problem downstream. The
objective of flood protection is no longer simply to
combat flood water using engineering methods. It is
far more important and effective to leave nature intact.
For example, floodplains can act like a sponge and retain
water, and mangrove forests work as natural coastal
protection from storm surges.
The Allianz Environmental Foundation also emphasizes
the importance of working together with nature. “It is
important to control damage in an emergency, as well
as to prevent the occurrence of emergencies as much
as possible through long-term prevention concepts and
applied research,” says Lutz Spandau, Chairman of the
Foundation. “We must leave the floodplains and recreate
more space for nature,” urges Spandau, stressing one of
the lessons learnt in the latest flooding disaster in early
summer 2013, when parts of Germany, Austria and the
Czech Republic found themselves under water.
His call has led to action. Since the summer of 2013, the
Allianz Environmental Foundation has been supporting
a project in the Riverlandscape Elbe biosphere reserve
near Magdeburg in Germany. The objective of the 30
or so construction measures is to significantly improve
water retention in the area by 2016. Many similar projects
have been implemented since the Foundation was
established in 1990, and these show how flooding can
be successfully managed in partnership with nature.

“We need to get off floodplains and
give back more space to nature.”
