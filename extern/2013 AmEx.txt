Q1 2013 UPDATE: PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT
T erms:
CSR Updat e Report s

[1]

American Express has always t aken social and environment al responsibilit y seriously and over t he years we’ve made progress
t o conserve energy, reduce wast e and promot e sust ainable use of nat ural resources. We’re pleased t o announce t hat we
achieved our inaugural five-year carbon foot print reduct ion goal, and we are commit t ing t o a new goal t o reduce our carbon
emissions in t he next five years.
In 2007, American Express first calculat ed t he company’s carbon foot print and set a five-year goal t o reduce it by 10
percent by 2012. We exceeded t his inaugural goal significant ly, lowering our carbon foot print by 27.5 percent including an
absolut e 10.2 percent decrease t hrough in elect ricit y use and business t ravel. While t his is significant progress, t here is
more work t o do. Our second generat ion carbon foot print reduct ion goal is t o reduce American Express’s carbon foot print an
addit ional 10 percent by 2017.

American Express' new offices at 1 John Street, Brighton, UK

Two major milest ones in greening our operat ions occurred during 2012. Earlier t his mont h, our new home in Bright on, U.K.
officially opened wit h a “Very Good” BREEAM rat ing. Use of low-energy light bulbs and ext ernal solar shading t o nat urally
moderat e t emperat ure help make t he building energy efficient while roof-t op solar panels reduce t he carbon int ensit y of t he
elect ricit y used. The façade feat ures vert ical gardens, and rainwat er harvest ed from t he roof will be used in t he operat ion of
t he building. This is our first building designed t o fully embrace BlueWork, t he t ransformat ion of American Express' work
spaces t o enable great er employee flexibilit y and space and resource efficiency. As we cont inue t o implement BlueWork in
2013 and beyond, we expect t hat improved space ut ilizat ion will help cont ribut e t o our new carbon reduct ion goal.
Anot her addit ion t o our port folio occurred in May of 2012 when we opened a brand new st at e-of-t he art dat a cent er in
Greensboro, Nort h Carolina here in t he U.S. A hub for Cardmember dat a processing, t he sit e uses onsit e solar and t hermal
energy sources and has received t he Leadership in Energy and Environment al Design (LEED) Gold Cert ificat ion. Due t o
business growt h and t he digit al t ransformat ion of our company, we expect elect ricit y use at dat a cent ers t o increase in t he
next few years. Thanks t o our new, efficient dat a cent er, t hese increases will be smaller t han t hey would have ot herwise
been.
Achieving our new goal will require effort s from all of our employees, in t he same way t hat t he achievement of our inaugural
goal was t he result of t eamwork across t he company. During t he past five years, absolut e reduct ions in elect ricit y use and
employee business t ravel result ed in an absolut e 10.2 percent reduct ion of American Express’ carbon foot print . To
encourage virt ual meet ings, we have been inst alling st at e-of-t he art Telepresence st udios and making t hem increasingly
accessible t o employees. Today we have 52 st udios in 36 office locat ions. Our dat a cent er and facilit ies managers have been
working hard t o opt imize operat ions and improve energy efficiency across our port folio. In t he coming years we will cont inue
t o perform upgrades t o office building cont rols and light ing, heat ing and cooling syst ems as well as cont inue t o expand our
use of virt ual servers and improve server ut ilizat ion at our dat a cent ers.
The balance of t he foot print reduct ion - 17.3 percent – came t hrough purchasing green power produced wit h low-carbon
sources like wind and solar. Today 29 percent of all our elect ricit y comes from green power, compared wit h none five years
ago. We work direct ly wit h our ut ilit y providers commit t ing t o long-t erm purchasing agreement s of large blocks of cert ified
renewable elect ricit y. American Express is proud t o help st imulat e demand for clean elect ricit y in t his manner, and help t he
t ransit ion t owards a low-carbon grid. We int end t o cont inue purchasing clean elect ricit y generat ed by wind, solar and ot her
renewable resources t o help reach our new goal.

In addit ion t o working on being more energy efficient at exist ing sit es and building new energy efficient sit es, we focused
t his year’s effort s on increased int ernal communicat ions around environment al issues. This included new eco informat ion
available on our employee int ranet , road shows and ramped up annual Eart h Day and Eart h Hour effort s. St art ing in 2013, we
plan t o get employees more involved in t aking st eps t o adopt environment ally preferable behaviors at work t hrough a
program we call Green2Get her.

Q2 2013 UPDATE: SERVING THE UNBANKED
T erms:
CSR Updat e Report s

[1]

According t o a survey [2] released by t he Federal Deposit Insurance Corporat ion (FDIC) in December, roughly one in 12
American households, or 17 million adult s, are "unbanked" – meaning t hat t hey do not have a current checking or savings
account .
Similarly, one in every five American households is "underbanked," meaning t hat t hey have a bank account , but t hat t hey also
rely on expensive alt ernat ive services -- like payday loans, check-cashing services, money orders and pawn shops – t o pay
bills or make ends meet .
According t o The Economist [3] (February 16, 2013), not all t he unbanked are poor nor do all poor people lack bank account s,
but t he rat e of t he unbanked among low-income households (defined in t he FDIC survey as t hose wit h an annual income
below $15,000) is more t han t hree t imes t he overall rat e. And, t he proport ion of poor Americans wit hout an account
compares badly wit h ot her developed count ries like It aly, Port ugal and Greece.
Oft en, t he unbanked have no alt ernat ive but t o use cash for t heir financial t ransact ions. Not only does t his mean consumers
incurring subst ant ial fees, but carrying large amount s of cash increases t he risk of t heft . It also means t hat consumers have
t o find places t hat accept cash payment s for expenses like elect ricit y and t elecommunicat ions.
St epping int o t his void, last Oct ober American Express and Walmart launched Bluebird, a new offering t hat provides
consumers wit h an alt ernat ive t o a t radit ional debit or checking account .
Bluebird offers consumers a payment capabilit y anywhere t hat t he American Express Card is honored. In addit ion t o t he
award-winning cust omer service t hat comes wit h an American Express Card, Bluebird members have access t o Purchase
Prot ect ion, which can provide coverage for accident al damage or t heft t o eligible purchases wit hin 90 days of purchase, as
well as t he abilit y t o add checks via smart phones, family sub-account s and no fee access t o cash at 22,000 ATMs for
Bluebird members who have enrolled in direct deposit .
Recent ly, based on feedback from cust omers, American Express and Walmart added capabilit ies like eligibilit y for FDIC
insurance coverage for all permanent Bluebird account s, an opt ion for ordering preaut horized Bluebird paper checks for t hose
merchant s who don't accept elect ronic payment s, and more ways t o add funds, including mailing a check t o American
Express. We also increased t he Bluebird account balance limit t o $100,000 annually.
The addit ion of FDIC coverage for permanent account s and t he increase in t he account balance limit means t hat cust omers
can now arrange for direct deposit of U.S. government payment s such as Social Securit y checks or t ax refunds direct ly int o
t heir Bluebird account s (t emporary account s are not eligible for FDIC coverage). It also provides an ext ra layer of securit y for
consumers – providing t hem wit h ext ra peace of mind.
"When we launched Bluebird last Oct ober, we were focused on serving t he t ens of millions of Americans who are not well
served by t he t radit ional financial services indust ry. The unbanked, underbanked, and t he unhappily banked are beset by
onerous fees and numerous inconveniences," said Dan Schulman, group president , Ent erprise Growt h at American Express.
"Bluebird is designed t o help make t heir everyday financial lives easier, more convenient and less expensive."
"Since launching Bluebird, we have been list ening t o our cust omers' feedback and working hard t o expand it s feat ures and
services," said Daniel Eckert , vice president of financial services for Walmart U.S. "Bluebird is helping cust omers st reamline
everyday money management wit hout t he frust rat ion of navigat ing complicat ed dos and don't s just t o avoid fees."
As of January, more t han 85% of Bluebird enrollees are new t o American Express and more t han 45% are under t he age of 35
– increasing t he number of consumers who are members of t he American Express net work and fulfilling a need t hat t hey
have for simple, convenient financial services.
Bluebird is available on-line at bluebird.com [4] and at more t han 4,000 Walmart st ores in t he Unit ed St at es.

Q3 2013 UPDATE: SAVING PAPER
T erms:
CSR Updat e Report s

[1]

Cut t ing t he usage of paper remains an import ant environment al goal, and at American Express, we have t aken several
measures over t he past seven years t o reduce bot h t he use of paper and t he weight of t he paper st ock t hat we do use.
The majorit y of t he paper we use comes from int egrat ed mills, which harvest and replant t heir own t rees on a cont inual basis.
In addit ion, t rees are harvest ed for t he home building and furnit ure indust ries, wit h some of t he remaining scraps purchased
by t he paper indust ry.
Our paper-relat ed eco init iat ive began in 2005, wit h a review of our paper program and our merchant /mill relat ionships. Our
Direct Market ing Excellence group creat ed an Eco Team t o evaluat e compet it ive mail best pract ices, and we reduced t he
paper weight of our direct mail reply envelopes by 17%, saving up t o 1,500 million pounds of paper annually.
In 2006 – 2007, our Membership Rewards cat alog moved t o a smaller format , and we t est ed new t ypes of paper. Working
wit h our primary uncoat ed paper source, we creat ed an American Express-specific paper st ock, 55# opaque, which we
successfully t est ed and rolled out in U.S. Consumer Card acquisit ion programs. Changes in paper st ock and reduct ions in
paper weight s had no impact on business result s, but t hey yielded significant cost savings, reduct ions in paper consumpt ion,
and our carbon foot print .
In 2008 - 2011, we cont inued t o validat e t he environment al cert ificat ions of our paper sources and key print suppliers, began
using t he Forest St ewardship Council (FSC) logo on acquisit ion mailings, and incorporat ed t he following t agline on our reply
envelopes and st at ement remit envelopes: "American Express will recycle t his envelope." In addit ion, we reduced our mock
card paper weight t o realize 250,000 pounds or 17% savings in annual paper t onnage.
In 2012, t hrough format reengineering, we reduced t he number of direct market ing print format s from 28 down t o 7 and
post card/self mailer format s from 30 variat ions t o 5, and we reduced paper weight s from 80# t o 70# and from 70# t o 60#.
For acquisit ion mail alone, paper t onnage was reduced in excess of 720,000 pounds.
At year end 2011, over 50% of our uncoat ed paper was 70# or higher. By t he end of t he first quart er 2013, 80% of uncoat ed
paper usage is now on 60#. We cont inue t his moment um wit h migrat ions t o 55# paper.
American Express cont inues t o find creat ive solut ions wit h bot h ext ernal and int ernal part ners working t o ident ify ways t o
reduce paper weight s wit hout impact ing business result s in a compet it ive environment . During t he seven years of t his paper
init iat ive, we have saved over 10 million pounds of paper, which has helped reduce solid wast e and aided wit h an overall
reduct ion in our carbon foot print .
